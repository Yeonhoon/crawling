0,The Diabetes Epidemic in Korea,2016 Sep;31(3):349-353.,Endocrinol Metab (Seoul),Junghyun Noh,https://doi.org/10.3803/enm.2016.31.3.349,"Diabetes is one of the foremost public health issues worldwide that can lead to complications in many organ systems, and has become a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Korea. According to data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), about 2.7 million Koreans (8.0%) aged 30 years or older had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2013. The prevalence of T2DM increased with age and rose from 5.6% in 2006 to 8.0% in 2013. Using data based on The Health Screening Service of the NHIS, 25% of Korean adults were reported to have prediabetes in 2013. The prevalence of an impaired fasting glucose tended to increase over time from 21.5% in 2006 to 25.0% in 2013. Even though nationwide health screening has been regularly conducted as a public service, the proportion of undiagnosed cases of diabetes was still reported to be on the higher side in the latest study. Based on the results of these epidemic studies, further actions will be needed to effectively implement lifestyle changes on a social level and increase measures for the early detection of diabetes to stem the tide of the epidemic."
1,Association of fasting serum glucose level and type 2 diabetes with hepatocellular carcinoma in men with chronic hepatitis B infection: A large cohort study,2018 Oct;102:103-113.,Eur J Cancer,Kyuwoong Kim,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2018.07.008,"Background: It is unclear whether elevated fasting serum glucose level and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), irrespective of obesity in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Patients and methods: Our study population comprised 214,167 Korean men with chronic hepatitis B in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database between January 2002 and December 2006. Data on new events of HCC were obtained by records of the NHIS during the follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, health status and clinical conditions to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of HCC associated with different categories of fasting serum glucose level and T2DM, using fasting serum glucose <90 mg/dL as reference.
Results: During the 8 years of follow-up, there were 11,241 HCCs in men with chronic hepatitis B. Compared with the reference group, fasting serum glucose level of more than 140 mg/dL (HR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.36-1.57; p < 0.001) and presence of T2DM (HR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.15-1.34; p < 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of HCC after controlling for potential confounders. Significant association with fasting serum glucose and HCC was found for both non-obese (<25 kg/m2) and obese (â‰¥25.0 kg/m2) patients (Ptrend < 0.001).
Conclusion: In this cohort of men with chronic hepatitis B infection, elevated fasting serum glucose level and T2DM were significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC, regardless of obesity. Glycaemic control in men with chronic hepatitis B patients should be considered in clinical practice to prevent HCC."
2,Utilization patterns of insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes from national health insurance claims data in South Korea,2019 Mar 6;14(3):e0210159.,PLoS One,Kyoung Lok Min,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210159,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that requires long-term therapy and regular check-ups to prevent complications. In this study, insurance claim data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea were used to investigate insulin use in T2DM patients according to the economic status of patients and their access to primary physicians, operationally defined as the frequently used medical care providers at the time of T2DM diagnosis. A total of 91,810 participants were included from the NHIS claims database for the period between 2002 and 2013. The utilization pattern of insulin was set as the dependent variable and classified as one of the following: non-use of antidiabetic drugs, use of oral antidiabetic drugs only, or use of insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs. The main independent variables of interest were level of income and access to a frequently-visited physician. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed. Insulin was used by 9,281 patients during the study period, while use was 2.874 times more frequent in the Medical-aid group than in the highest premium group [hazard ratio (HR): 2.874, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.588-3.192]. Insulin was also used ~50% more often in the patients managed by a frequently-visited physician than in those managed by other healthcare professionals (HR: 1.549, 95% CI: 1.434-1.624). The lag time to starting insulin was shorter when the patients had a low income and no frequently-visited physicians. Patients with a low level of income were more likely to use insulin and to have a shorter lag time from diagnosis to starting insulin. The likelihood of insulin being used was higher when the patients had a frequently-visited physician, particularly if they also had a low level of income. Therefore, the economic statuses of patients should be considered to ensure effective management of T2DM. Utilizing frequently-visited physicians might improve the management of T2DM, particularly for patients with a low income."
3,"Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among Korean Children, Adolescents, and Adults Younger than 30 Years: Changes from 2002 to 2016",2021 Oct 26.,Diabetes Metab J,Yong Hee Hong,https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2021.0038,"Background: Despite the importance of and social concern regarding prevention of diabetes at younger ages, limited data are available. This study sought to analyze changes in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Koreans younger than 30 years according to sex, age, and level of income.
Methods: The dataset analyzed in this study was derived from health insurance claims recorded in the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database. Participants' level of income was categorized as low (quintile 1, <20% of insurance premium) or others (quintile 2-5).
Results: In males and females, the prevalence of T2DM per 10,000 people steadily increased from 2.57 in 2002 to 11.41 in 2016, and from 1.96 in 2002 to 8.63 in 2016. The prevalence of T2DM in girls was higher in the age group of 5 to 14 years. Even though the prevalence was higher among those older than 20 years, the increase had started earlier, in the early 2000s, in younger age group. Adolescents aged 10 to 19 years in low-income families showed a remarkable increase in prevalence of T2DM, especially in boys.
Conclusion: The prevalence of T2DM in young Koreans increased more than 4.4-fold from 2002 to 2016, and the increase started in the early 2000s in younger age groups and in low-income families. This is the first study to examine the trend in prevalence of T2DM in children, adolescents, and young adults in Korea. Future studies and collaborations with social support systems to prevent T2DM at an early age group should be performed."
4,"Depression and Mortality in People with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, 2003 to 2013: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study",2017 Aug;41(4):296-302.,Diabetes Metab J,Jong Hyun Jeong,https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2017.41.4.296,"Background: Previous reports have demonstrated a bidirectional relationship between depression and diabetes mellitus (DM), accentuating a need for more intensive depression screening in DM patients. There is a relative paucity of data on the mortality of depressed DM patients in Korea.
Methods: Retrospective data from January 2003 to December 2013 were collected for adult type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients older than 30 years using the National Health Information database maintained by the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). Demographic characteristics were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and the annual prevalence of depression was estimated. Mortality rates and hazard ratios for each age group (stratified into six age groups) of patients diagnosed with T2DM in 2003 were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard method, with the Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival curve showing the overall survival rates according to the T2DM status until the given year of 2013.
Results: The annual prevalence of depression was consistently higher in T2DM group from 2003 to 2013. The mortality hazard ratio was higher in the depressed in all age groups, and the risk was higher in male groups and in younger-aged groups.
Conclusion: Depression was significantly associated with a high mortality risk in T2DM patients; hence, a more systematic surveillance of T2DM patients to identify risk factors for depression might contribute significantly to reducing mortality risk in this group of patients."
5,Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Based Diabetes Prediction System Using a Nationwide Population-Based Cohort,2021 Jul;45(4):515-525.,Diabetes Metab J,Sang Youl Rhee,https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2020.0081,"Background: Previously developed prediction models for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have limited performance. We developed a deep learning (DL) based model using a cohort representative of the Korean population.
Methods: This study was conducted on the basis of the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening (NHIS-HEALS) cohort of Korea. Overall, 335,302 subjects without T2DM at baseline were included. We developed the model based on 80% of the subjects, and verified the power in the remainder. Predictive models for T2DM were constructed using the recurrent neural network long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) network and the Cox longitudinal summary model. The performance of both models over a 10-year period was compared using a time dependent area under the curve.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 10.4Â±1.7 years, the mean frequency of periodic health check-ups was 2.9Â±1.0 per subject. During the observation period, T2DM was newly observed in 8.7% of the subjects. The annual performance of the model created using the RNN-LSTM network was superior to that of the Cox model, and the risk factors for T2DM, derived using the two models were similar; however, certain results differed.
Conclusion: The DL-based T2DM prediction model, constructed using a cohort representative of the population, performs better than the conventional model. After pilot tests, this model will be provided to all Korean national health screening recipients in the future."
6,Declined incidence of patients treated for vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in South Korea: a 12-year nationwide population-based study,2021 Aug 19.,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Jiwon Kim,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-021-05365-z,"Purpose: To determine the age- and sex-specific annual incidence rates of patients treated for VTDR and the factors associated with increased treatment rates in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in South Korea.
Methods: This was a nationwide, retrospective, 12-year, population-based study. Patients aged over 30 years who were diagnosed with T2DM between 2006 and 2017 were included in this study. We evaluated the national health claims data acquired from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Main outcome measures were the annual incidence rates of patients treated for VTDR and the associated risk factors.
Results: The age-adjusted annual incidence rate of patients treated for VTDR significantly decreased from 10.05 per 1000 T2DM patients in 2006 to 6.11 in 2017 (Î² = - 0.3192, P < 0.0001). The sex-adjusted annual incidence rate also significantly decreased in both men (Î² = - 0.2861, P < 0.0001) and women (Î² = - 0.3666, P < 0.0001). Cox hazard analysis showed that factors such as insulin use, young age, chronic kidney disease and male sex were significantly associated with increased rate of treatments for VTDR. In addition, the risk was lower for rural than for metropolitan residents.
Conclusions: Despite the increase in the number of T2DM patients in South Korea, the incidence rate of patients treated for VTDR decreases with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Therefore, it is important to detect and manage high-risk groups early to prevent visual impairment due to VTDR."
