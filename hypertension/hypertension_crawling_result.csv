0,Body fat change and 8-year incidence of hypertension: Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study,2019 Dec;21(12):1849-1857.,J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),Sung-Bum Lee,https://doi.org/10.1111/jch.13723,"Hypertension is strongly correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Recent studies have demonstrated that body fat percentage (BF%) is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between a change in BF% and body mass index (BMI) and the incidence of new-onset hypertension in a normotensive Korean cohort. At baseline (2001-2002), 8848 participants aged 40-70 years were recruited for the study; follow-up surveys were completed in the year 2012. A total of 3902 adults (1866 men and 2036 women) were included in the final analysis. These subjects were divided into quartile groups according to changes in BF% and were followed for 8.4 years to monitor for the development of hypertension. A Poisson regression model was used to evaluate the relative risk (RR) for hypertension according to BF% change quartile. Additionally, we also stratified participants into four groups according to BMI change levels and body fat change levels. Finally, we compared two factors, BF% change, and BMI change, to determine which is more predictive of incident hypertension. In an adjusted model, compared with the lowest BF% quartile group, the risk of new-onset hypertension significantly increased with BF% change: Changes in risk were 0%-2.0% for quartile 3 subjects (RR: 1.32 [1.06-1.63]) and 2.0%-8.9% for quartile 4 participants (RR: 1.78 [1.43-2.19]). We also revealed that the RR for new-onset hypertension was 1.81 (95% CI: 1.47-2.21) for quartile 4 group subjects, compared with subjects in quartile 1 (change in BMI -6.80 to -0.86% [kg/m2 ]). Body fat gain and BMI increase were predictors of hypertension in this community-based Korean cohort."
1,Change in Body Mass Index and Its Impact on Incidence of Hypertension in 18-65-Year-Old Chinese Adults,2016 Feb 25;13(3):257.,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Qian Ren,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph13030257,"Aims: This study assessed change in body mass index (BMI) and its impact on the incidence of hypertension in 18- to 65-year-old Chinese adults.

Methods: Two waves of data were collected in 2006 and 2011 by the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) with samples drawn from nine provinces in China. The logistic regression model was used to examine the association between change in BMI and the incidence of hypertension, and odds ratio (OR) and 95% confident interval (95% CI) were calculated.

Results: The risk of incident hypertension increased as the quartile of the BMI difference value (D-value) increased in men (OR and 95% CI for the highest quartile vs. the lowest quartile: 2.303, 1.560-3.401, respectively, p for trend < 0.001) and women (OR and 95% CI for the highest quartile vs. the lowest quartile: 1.745, 1.199-2.540, respectively, p for trend = 0.004). Compared with non-overweight subjects in 2011, the ORs of incident hypertension were all significantly higher for overweight subjects, regardless of their overweight status at baseline (p < 0.05).

Conclusions: In conclusion, the results from this study provide unequivocal evidence that prevention of weight gain is likely to have a great impact on the incidence of hypertension in Chinese adults."
2,"The role of body weight, fat distribution and weight change in ethnic differences in the 9-year incidence of hypertension",2014 May;32(5):990-6; discussion 996-7.,J Hypertens,Laura R Grootveld,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000000135,"Objective: To investigate the role of body composition (body weight, fat distribution and weight change over time) in ethnic differences in the incidence of hypertension in an ethnic Dutch, South Asian Surinamese and African Surinamese background population living in the Netherlands.

Methods: We included 361 participants without hypertension at baseline (147 ethnic Dutch, 82 South Asian Surinamese, 132 African Surinamese), aged 35-60 years, in whom anthropometric measurements and blood pressures were measured at baseline and after mean 9 years of follow-up. Data were analysed using logistic regression analyses, with hypertension at follow up as a dependent variable.

Results: Body weight, fat distribution and weight gain were positively associated with the risk of developing hypertension; these associations did not statistically significantly differ between ethnic groups [odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence interval (95% CI) per SD: BMI 1.5 (1.2-2.0); waist circumference 1.5 (1.2-1.9); waist to hip ratio (WHR) 1.4 (1.1-1.9), weight gain of 1-2.9 kg/m 1.8 (0.9-3.8)]. As compared with Dutch, a higher incidence of hypertension was found among South Asian Surinamese [OR 2.6 (1.4-4.8)] and in particular among African Surinamese [OR 3.1 (1.76-5.30)]. Among South Asian Surinamese, adjustment for WHR attenuated the OR the most [OR 1.9 (1.0-3.7)]; among African Surinamese, the strongest effect was observed for adjustment by BMI and WHR simultaneously [OR 2.5 (1.4-4.4)].

Conclusion: The ethnic differences in the incidence of hypertension among a middle-aged group with a Dutch, South Asian Surinamese and African Surinamese background were partly explained by body composition. This suggests that other factors may be involved, including genetic factors or unidentified other determinants."
3,The correlation between the MRI-evaluated ectopic fat accumulation and the incidence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension depends on body mass index and waist circumference ratio,2020 Jan 27;15(1):e0226889.,PLoS One,Joanna Pie??kowska,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0226889,"The widespread presence of overweight and obesity increases with every decade, and the number of people with body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2 has doubled in the last 30 years. 
The aim of the study is to assess the correlation between MRI-evaluated ectopic fat accumulation in pancreas, skeletal muscles and liver and the incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, depending on BMI and waist circumference ratio. This prospective study included 267 consecutive patients who were referred to abdominal MRI and underwent a standard clinical assessment with BMI and waist circumference ratio calculation. Ectopic fat accumulation in pancreas, skeletal muscles and liver was evaluated in magnetic resonance imaging using the fat-water separated Dixon imaging. There were statistically significant differences in mean steatosis of all assessed organs in the group of patients with type 2 diabetes or hypertension in comparison to the non-diabetic group as well as to the group without hypertension. It has been observed that pancreas and skeletal muscles are more susceptible to fat accumulation than liver. According to our results, there is a relation between the fat content in muscles, pancreas and liver, the incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and also body mass index and waist circumference ratio. We believe that future studies should aim to determine whether the use of fat content measurement in certain organs could be used as a biomarker that can enable early detection of reversible metabolic changes, as well as their subsequent monitoring."
4,Effect of long-term body weight change on the incidence of hypertension in Japanese men and women,2004 Mar;28(3):391-5.,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,J S Lee,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.0802568,"Objective: To elucidate the effect of long-term body weight changes on the subsequent incidence of hypertension in a large sample of community-residing Japanese males and females.
Methods: Subjects were 3431 men and 2409 women, between 30 and 69 y old, who underwent annual periodic health examinations from 1987 (baseline year) until 1996. They were free from hypertension during the first 5 y from the baseline year. Body weight change index between 1987 and 1992 was the body mass index (BMI) (weight (kg) over height (m) squared) slope. Multiple logistic analysis was performed to assess the effect of BMI slope on the incidence of hypertension during the subsequent 5 ys (1992-1996), while controlling for baseline age, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and smoking habit.
Results: During the first 5 y, the prevalence of overweight males (25.0< or =BMI<30.0) significantly increased from 18.4 to 23.5% in males and from 10.4 to 14.1% in females. In all, 11.7% of the males and 8.9% of the females developed hypertension between 1992 and 1996. Those who developed hypertension had a significantly higher baseline age, BMI, SBP and DBP both in males and females. The baseline smoking rate among the females who developed hypertension was significantly lower than those who did not develop the hypertension. After adjustment of these covariables by the multiple logistic analysis, the BMI slope was positively correlated with the incidence of hypertension both in females and males significantly.
Conclusions: Weight gain increased the risk of developing hypertension independent of age and blood pressure level among relatively lean Japanese men and women."
5,Left ventricular mass and incident out-of-office hypertension in a general population,2020 Apr;38(4):633-640.,J Hypertens,Cesare Cuspidi,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000002313,"Aim: Findings regarding the association of left ventricular mass (LVM) and new-onset hypertension are based on blood pressure measured in the office. We sought to assess the value of LVM in predicting in-office and out-of-office incident hypertension in members of the general population enrolled in the Pressioni Monitorate E Loro Associazioni study.

Methods: The study included participants with normal office (n = 792), home (n = 714) and 24-h (n = 825) ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) at baseline evaluation who had a readable echocardiogram at entry and at the end of follow-up. Each normotensive group was divided into quartiles of LVM indexed (LVMI) to height.

Results: Over a follow-up of 148 months cumulative incidence of new office, home and 24-h ABP hypertension were 35.9, 30.7 and 36.1%, respectively. In fully adjusted models (including age, sex, BMI change during follow-up, baseline serum glucose, creatinine, total cholesterol office, home and 24-h SBP and DBP). higher LVMI values (i.e. the highest vs. the lowest quartile) were independently associated with an increased risk of home [odds ratio (OR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-3.77, P = 0.008] and 24-h ABP hypertension (OR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.05-2.76, P = 0.03). This was not the case for new-onset office hypertension (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 0.94-2.74, P = 0.07).

Conclusion: Our study provides the first evidence that in normotensive individuals the magnitude of LVMI is independently associated with the risk of incident out-of-office hypertension."
6,"Metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and nervous system injury: Epidemiological correlates",2017;39(1):8-16.,Clin Exp Hypertens,Giovanna Ricci,https://doi.org/10.1080/10641963.2016.1210629,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common and complex disorder combining hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. MetS represents a risk factor for changes in cognitive functions in older age, and several studies have suggested that MetS may be linked to dementia. This article reviews the main evidences about the relationship between MetS and neurodegenerative disease. Starting from an epidemiological point of view, the article analyzes medico-social aspects related to MetS, considering the reduction of work capacity and the condition of disability that it involves. Some authors affirm that on the basis of current Italian legislation, it is possible to consider the syndrome as a disability. This is because all the diseases that make up MetS are high-risk clinical pathological conditions. For these reasons, a joint action is required to contain the incidence of MetS, the high social costs, and the loss of productivity related to the syndrome. In conclusion, healthcare initiatives could be adopted in order to increase the understanding of the pathogenic contributions of each element on MetS and how they can be modified. These actions will be useful to reduce healthcare costs and can lead to more effective prevention of metabolic disease, thus promoting good health.

7,Association between body mass index changes and short- and long-term outcomes of hypertension in a Chinese rural cohort study,2020 Sep;34(8):593-601.,J Hum Hypertens,Zihui Gao,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41371-019-0276-x,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of body mass index (BMI) changes on hypertension among rural areas of China. A population-based sample of 13,263 and 5944 rural Chinese people aged >=35 years and without hypertension at baseline was included in our analysis of BMI changes (from (2004-2006) to 2008) and short- and long-term outcomes of hypertension (from 2008 to 2010 and 2010 to 2017). The participants were divided into four groups by a comprehensive cross-sectional combination according to baseline BMI (18.5-24 vs. ???24 kg/m2) and follow-up changes (decreased vs. increased). Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). During a median follow-up period of 4.8 (short-term) and 11.7 (long-term) years, 2299 (17.33%) and 2020 (33.98%) participants developed hypertension, respectively. 

For participants with a baseline BMI ??? 24 kg/m2, when BMI decreased in follow-ups, the multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CI) of short-term hypertension were 0.898 (0.857-0.942). For baseline 18.5 kg/m2 <= BMI < 24 kg/m2, when BMI increased in follow-ups, the risks of short-term hypertension were 1.103 (1.068-1.139). We detected that BMI changes had a lower impact on the incidence of hypertension in long-term than short-term. Our study indicated that BMI changes were significantly associated with the incidence of hypertension for the short-term, and it had a stronger impact on short-term outcomes than long-term. Managing weight by lifestyle modification was particularly important for the primary prevention of hypertension in rural Chinese population."
8,Prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension and its risk factors in Iranian school children: a population-based study,2018 Sep;36(9):1816-1824.,J Hypertens,Hossein Ebrahimi,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000001789,"Objective: Because of the incidence of a childhood obesity epidemic and the widespread changes in people's lifestyle, the prevalence of high blood pressure in children is increasing. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension and its risk factors in Iranian children.

Methods: Using random cluster sampling in urban areas and census in rural areas, a total of 5620 schoolchildren aged 6-12 years living in Shahroud, Northeast of Iran, were studied. The prevalence of hypertension was determined on the basis of the fourth report of the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in children and adolescents by age, sex, and place of residence. The factors influencing blood pressure were studied using multivariate regression.

Results: The prevalence of prehypertension was 7.44% and the prevalence of hypertension was 6.82%. The relative risk ratio (RRR) of prehypertension was 1.17 for BMI, 1.43 for female sex, and 3.71 for residence in rural areas; in addition, the RRR of hypertension was 1.22 for BMI, 6.64 for residence in rural areas, 1.69 for moderate economic status, and 1.89 for low economic status.

Conclusion: The prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension is significant in children and alarming in rural areas and requires urgent intervention. As factors such as high BMI, female sex, residence in rural areas, and moderate and low economic status are associated with increased risk of prehypertension and hypertension, it is recommended to conduct routine care programs at regular intervals in schools to prevent hypertension and its related complications."
9,[Association between obesity in childhood and hypertension incidence: a prospective cohort study],2011 Aug;45(8):696-701.,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Hong Cheng,,"Objective: To explore the impact of obesity level and the level change in childhood on hypertension incidence.
Methods: A perspective cohort study was conducted. As part of Beijing Child and Adolescent Metabolic Syndrome Study, 2189 aged 6 - 16 year non-hypertensive children was followed up in December, 2010. In this study, height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and blood pressure was measured at follow-up, and body mass index (BMI) and WC was respectively used to assess overweight, obesity and abdominal obesity. Non-conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between baseline obesity status, change of obesity status and hypertension incidence. OR and 95%CI were computed in the model using obese status as dummy variable and hypertension at follow up visit as dependent variable.

Results: The total hypertension incidence of 1184 subjects during 6 years follow-up was 19.9% (236/1184). The hypertension incidence in male (23.2%, 149/643) was higher than that in female (16.1%, 87/541) (??(2) = 9.257, P = 0.002). The hypertension incidence of non-overweight, overweight and obese children at baseline was 8.7% (45/519), 19.3% (35/181) and 32.4% (156/484) respectively (??(2) = 9.332, P < 0.001), and the incidence of non-obese and abdominal obese children at baseline was respectively 10.3% (63/613) and 30.7% (173/567) (??(2) = 77.753, P < 0.001). Hypertension incidence in the baseline obesity group was higher than the non-overweight (BMI: OR = 4.9, 95%CI: 3.4 - 7.0) and non-obese group (WC: OR = 3.9, 95%CI: 2.8 - 5.3). The hypertension incidence increased with the follow-up BMI/WC level, based on the same baseline level of BMI and WC. The hypertension risk increased to 0.21 and 0.07 times respectively with elevation of baseline BMI level by 1 kg/m(2) and WC level by 1 cm, and OR (95%CI) were 1.21 (1.16 - 1.26) and 1.07 (1.05 - 1.09), respectively. Similarly, the hypertension risk increased 0.16 and 0.05 times respectively with the elevation of BMI level change by 1 kg/m(2) and 1 cm, and OR (95%CI) were 1.16 (1.11 - 1.22) and 1.05 (1.03 - 1.07), respectively.

Conclusion: Obesity and increased obesity level change in childhood can increase the risk of incident hypertension."
10,Decreases in adiposity reduce the risk of hypertension: Results from a prospective cohort of adolescents,2019 Mar;120:1-7.,Prev Med,Joana Ara??jo,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2018.12.017,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of age-related changes in body mass index and waist circumference during adolescence on blood pressure levels and incidence of hypertension. 

Among the 2159 adolescents recruited at 13 years in Porto, Portugal, we evaluated those free of hypertension at baseline and followed-up at 17 years (n = 1377) - EPITeen cohort, 2003-2008. Changes in BMI percentage (BMI%) and waist circumference percentage (WC%) were evaluated continuously as the difference between 13 and 17 years, then categorized in sex-specific quartiles. Hypertension was defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure ??? 95th sex- age- and height-specific reference percentile. The association between changes in adiposity and incidence of hypertension was computed through generalized linear models with log link function and Poisson distribution [incidence rate ratios (IRR), 95% confidence intervals (95%CI)], adjusting for baseline adiposity, sex, and family history of hypertension. Overall incidence rate of hypertension was 23.8 (95%CI 19.6-28.8) per 1000 person-years. Participants presenting the highest decrease in BMI% from 13 to 17 years (1st quartile) presented lower SBP at 17y, while for those with increasing BMI% (4th quartile) SBP increased. In comparison to stable BMI% (3rd quartile), decreases in BMI% (1st quartile) were associated with 44% lower risk of hypertension at 17y (IRR = 0.56, 95%CI 0.32-0.97). Increases in BMI% (4th quartile) were associated with increased incidence, although without statistical significance (IRR = 1.11, 95%CI 0.66-1.85). 

Results were similar when considering changes in WC%. Decreases in BMI and WC throughout adolescence in the whole spectrum of adiposity levels presented potential benefit for blood pressure."
11,Hypertension and its severity in children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome during remission,2018 Oct;22(5):1157-1162.,Clin Exp Nephrol,Swasti Keshri,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10157-018-1565-3,"Background and objective: Hypertension is not a typical feature of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and the presence of persistent hypertension is suggestive of significant renal lesion. There is paucity of data regarding occurrence and severity of hypertension in SSNS in pediatric population during remission and was the main objective of this study. In addition, correlation with factors like family history, BMI, and lipid profile was studied.

Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted at tertiary care center in India including 81 children of infrequent relapsing SSNS between 1 and 10 years in remission and was off steroids. Grading and severity of hypertension were assessed. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 21.0.

Results: Median age of presentation was 5 years, with male:female ratio of 1.3:1. Out of 81 infrequent relapsing SSNS children, 23.45% (19) had hypertension. Among those children with hypertension (n = 19), 73.68% (14) had positive family history compared to 32.25% (20) in those without hypertension. Positive correlation was found between BP and serum cholesterol and LDL. Of the hypertensive patients, 1 (5.26%) had fundus changes, 2 (10.52%) had features of left ventricular hypertrophy, and 13 (68.42%) had non-nephrotic range proteinuria.

Conclusion: There is high incidence of hypertension in NS children during remission. Though significant positive correlation was found with positive family history of hypertension and deranged lipid profile highlighting possibility of essential hypertension in them, there is need for close active monitoring and management of hypertension in them as untreated cases may have significant target organ damage."
12,Changes in Leisure Time Physical Activity Preferences and Hypertension Risk,2019 Jan 1;43(1):145-157.,Am J Health Behav,Junmin Zhou,https://doi.org/10.5993/ajhb.43.1.12,"Objectives: In this study, we examined the association between changes in leisure time physical activity (LTPA) preference (the extent to which participants liked or disliked certain types of physical activity) and the incidence of hypertension; we also assessed whether the association differed between urban and rural China. 

Methods: Based on longitudinal data from 2687 Chinese adults between 2004 and 2011, we performed multivariate logistic regressions were to assess the aforementioned association. We conducted stratified analyses to examine the urban-rural differences in this association. 

Results: The mean age was 40.0 (Standard Deviation = 12.5), and the mean BMI was 23.7 (Standard Deviation = 3.3). Adjusted estimates show that relative to respondents with no changes in LTPA preference, respondents who reduced preference were more likely to develop hypertension (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.13-3.28). This association, however, was statistically significant among urban residents (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.04-4.60), but not rural participants.

 Conclusions: Changes in LTPA preference and development of hypertension were significantly correlated, especially among urban Chinese. Hypertension prevention programs may identify the groups at elevated risk by examining levels and changes of LTPA preferences."
13,Association Between Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension and Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases in Women in the United Kingdom,2019 Sep 1;76(9):1088-1098.,JAMA Neurol,Nicola J Adderley,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2019.1812,"Importance: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has not been previously evaluated in a large matched cohort study in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
Objectives: To estimate the risk of composite cardiovascular events, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), type 2 diabetes, and hypertension in women with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and compare it with the risk in women, matched on body mass index (BMI) and age, without the condition; and to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of IIH.
Design, setting, and participants: This population-based matched controlled cohort study used 28 years of data, from January 1, 1990, to January 17, 2018, from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), an anonymized, nationally representative electronic medical records database in the United Kingdom. All female patients aged 16 years or older were eligible for inclusion. Female patients with IIH (n = 2760) were included and randomly matched with up to 10 control patients (n = 27 125) by BMI and age.
Main outcomes and measures: Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of cardiovascular outcomes were calculated using Cox regression models. The primary outcome was a composite of any CVD (heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/TIA), and the secondary outcomes were each CVD outcome, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.
Results: In total, 2760 women with IIH and 27 125 women without IIH were included. Age and BMI were similar between the 2 groups, with a median (interquartile range) age of 32.1 (25.6-42.0) years in the exposed group and 32.1 (25.7-42.1) years in the control group; in the exposed group 1728 women (62.6%) were obese, and in the control group 16514 women (60.9%) were obese. Higher absolute risks for all cardiovascular outcomes were observed in women with IIH compared with control patients. The aHRs were as follows: composite cardiovascular events, 2.10 (95% CI, 1.61-2.74; P < .001); heart failure, 1.97 (95% CI, 1.16-3.37; P = .01); ischemic heart disease, 1.94 (95% CI, 1.27-2.94; P = .002); stroke/TIA, 2.27 (95% CI, 1.61-3.21; P < .001); type 2 diabetes, 1.30 (95% CI, 1.07-1.57; P = .009); and hypertension, 1.55 (95% CI, 1.30-1.84; P < .001). The incidence of IIH in female patients more than tripled between 2005 and 2017, from 2.5 to 9.3 per 100 000 person-years. Similarly, IIH prevalence increased in the same period, from 26 to 79 per 100 000 women. Incidence increased markedly with BMI higher than 30.
Conclusions and relevance: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in women appeared to be associated with a 2-fold increase in CVD risk; change in patient care to modify risk factors for CVD may reduce long-term morbidity for women with IIH and warrants further evaluation."

Cross-sectional and prospective associations in the Copenhagen City Heart Study,2020 Mar 1;46(2):188-197.,Scand J Work Environ Health,Mette Korsh??j,https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.3850,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate cross-sectional and prospective associations between heavy occupational lifting and hypertension. 

Methods Data from the third, fourth and fifth examinations of the Copenhagen City Heart Study were included. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to adjust for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, education, self-rated cardiorespiratory fitness, vital exhaustion and baseline blood pressure, and were used to estimate (i) the cross-sectional association between heavy occupational lifting and hypertension, defined as using anti-hypertensives or having a systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=90 mmHg, and (ii) the prospective association between heavy occupational lifting and risk of becoming a systolic blood pressure case, defined as an above median change (from baseline to follow-up) and/or a shift from no use of anti-hypertensives at baseline to use of anti-hypertensives at a ten-year follow-up. 

Results Both cross-sectional [odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.20] and prospective (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.31) analysis indicated no relations. Explorative prospective analyses suggested linear associations between heavy occupational lifting and systolic blood pressure among participants using anti-hypertensives. Exposure to heavy occupational lifting tended to increase the incidence of hypertension (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.97-1.73) among participants ???50 years. 

Conclusions No associations were seen among the general population. Positive associations were seen among users of anti-hypertensives and participants ???50 years, indicating these groups as vulnerable to increases in blood pressure when exposed to occupational lifting."

Results: Among 36293 participants without hypertension at baseline, 1831 reported incident hypertension (5??1 % incidence) at follow-up. Two dietary patterns were identified: 'Modern' and 'Prudent'. The Modern dietary pattern (high intakes of roasted/smoked foods, instant foods, canned foods, fermented fruits/vegetables, fermented foods, soft drinks, deep-fried foods) was associated with increased incident hypertension (comparing extreme quartiles, OR for incident hypertension=1??51; 95 % CI 1??31, 1??75 in 2013). The Prudent dietary pattern (high intakes of soyabean products, milk, fruits, vegetables) was not associated with incident hypertension in a fully adjusted model. The association between the Modern dietary pattern and hypertension was attenuated by BMI.

Conclusions: Modern dietary pattern was positively associated with hypertension among Thai adults. BMI had a great impact on the relationship between the Modern dietary pattern and incidence of hypertension. Reduction of Modern diets would be expected to prevent and control hypertension. Such a strategy would be worth testing."
16,High-Intensity Interval Training Decreases Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity in Men With Essential Hypertension and in Normotensive Controls,2020 Aug 18;14:841.,Front Neurosci,Thomas Svare Ehlers,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.00841,"Exercise training is a cornerstone in reducing blood pressure (BP) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in individuals with essential hypertension. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to be a time efficient alternative to classical continuous training in lowering BP in essential hypertension, but the effect of HIIT on MSNA levels has never been investigated. Leg MSNA responsiveness to 6 weeks of HIIT was examined in 14 hypertensive men (HYP; age: 62 ?? 7 years, night time BP: 136 ?? 12/83 ?? 8 mmHg, BMI: 28 ?? 3 kg/m2), and 10 age-matched normotensive controls (NORM; age: 60 ?? 8 years, night time BP: 116 ?? 2/68 ?? 4 mmHg and BMI: 27 ?? 3 kg/m2). Before training, MSNA levels were not different between HYP and NORM (burst frequency (BF): 41.0 ?? 10.3 vs. 33.6 ?? 10.6 bursts/min and burst incidence (BI): 67.5 ?? 19.7 vs. 64.2 ?? 17.0 bursts/100 heart beats, respectively). BF decreased (P < 0.05) with training by 13 and 5% in HYP and NORM, respectively, whereas BI decreased by 7% in NORM only, with no difference between groups. Training lowered (P < 0.05) night-time mean arterial- and diastolic BP in HYP only (100 ?? 8 vs. 97 ?? 5, and 82 ?? 6 vs. 79 ?? 5 mmHg, respectively). 

The change in HYP was greater (P < 0.05) compared to NORM. Training reduced (P < 0.05) body mass, visceral fat mass, and fat percentage similarly within- and between groups, with no change in fat free mass. Training increased (P < 0.05) V??O2-max in NORM only. Six weeks of HIIT lowered resting MSNA levels in age-matched hyper- and normotensive men, which was paralleled by a significant reduction in BP in the hypertensive men."

We analyzed the prevalence and risk factors of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus (DM) after adult living donor liver transplantation.

Methods: Fifty-four adult recipients with a minimum follow up of 6 months receiving living donor liver transplantation between 2001 and 2012 at the Tohoku University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed.

Results: The prevalence of hypertension increased from 18.5% before transplantation to 35.2% post-transplantation, and new-onset hypertension after transplantation was 57.9% of post-transplant hypertension. Univariate analysis showed that risk factors of post-transplant hypertension were age (>50 years, P = 0.0023), pretransplant body mass index (BMI) of 25 or more (P = 0.0123), pretransplant hypertension (P = 0.0012) and cyclosporin A (61.5% vs tacrolimus 25.0%, P = 0.0248). The incidence of obesity, dyslipidemia and DM did not change from before to after transplantation. LTx was curative in 77.8% of cases of pretransplant dyslipidemia and 20% of cases of pretransplant DM. Primary biliary cirrhosis cases comprised 85.7% of cases of pretransplant dyslipidemia that were cured by LTx. In univariate analysis, pretransplant BMI of 25 or more was the only risk factor of post-transplant dyslipidemia (P = 0.0098). The incidence of new-onset DM after transplantation was 20%. Risk factors of post-transplant DM were male sex (P = 0.0156), pretransplant DM (P < 0.0001), alcohol abuse (P = 0.0248) and mycophenolate mofetil (P = 0.0181) by univariate analysis.

Conclusion: The prevalence of hypertension increased after LTx and pretransplant obesity was associated with several post-transplant metabolic abnormalities."
18,"Time trend in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in a contemporary cohort of HIV-infected patients: the HIV and Hypertension Study",2017 Feb;35(2):409-416.,J Hypertens,Giuseppe Vittorio De Socio,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000001150,"Background: Hypertension control is often inadequate in HIV patients. In a contemporary, nationwide cohort of Italian HIV-infected adults, we assessed time trends in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control. We also evaluated predictors of cardiovascular events and of new-onset hypertension.

Methods: Multicenter prospective cohort study, sampling 961 consecutive HIV patients (71% men, mean age 46 ?? 9 years, 30% hypertensive) examined in 2010-2014 and after a median follow-up of 3.4 years.

Results: Among hypertensive patients, hypertension awareness (63% at baseline and 92% at follow-up), treatment (54 vs. 79%), and control (35 vs. 59%) all improved during follow-up. The incidence of new-onset hypertension was 50.1/1000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 41.2-60.3). Multivariable-adjusted predictors of hypertension were age, BMI, estimated cardiovascular risk, blood pressure, and advanced HIV clinical stage.In total, 35 new cardiovascular events were reported during follow-up (11.1/1000 person-years). In a multivariate model, baseline cardiovascular risk and hypertensive status predicted incident cardiovascular events, whereas a higher CD4 cell count had a protective role. In treated hypertensive patients, the use of integrase strand transfer inhibitors at follow-up was associated with a lower SBP (average yearly change, -3.8 ?? 1.6 vs. -0.9 ?? 0.5 mmHg in integrase strand transfer inhibitor users vs. nonusers, respectively, P = 0.02).

Conclusion: Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rates all improved in adult Italian HIV patients over the last few years, although hypertension remains highly prevalent (41%) in middle-aged HIV patients, and significantly impacts cardiovascular morbidity. Traditional risk factors and advanced HIV disease predict new-onset hypertension, whereas CD4 cell count favorably affects future cardiovascular events."
19,Correlation between changes in inflammatory cytokines and the combination with hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,2019 Sep;44(3):252-258.,Minerva Endocrinol,Qinghua He,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0391-1977.18.02822-5,"Background: We aimed to analyze the relationship between the combination with hypertension and the level of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral serum in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and to explore the value of inflammatory cytokines in predicting type 2 DM combined with hypertension.

Methods: A total of 120 patients diagnosed with type 2 DM in our hospital from March 2014 to September 2016 were selected. The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were divided into the combination with hypertension group (N.=56) and the non-combination with hypertension group (N.=64), including 75 males and 45 females.

Results: Duration of DM, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and also levels of inflammatory cytokines (hs-CRP, TNF-?? and IL-6) in the combination with hypertension group were all significantly higher than those in the non-combination with hypertension group (P<0.05). The incidence rate of hypertension in patients with high-level hs-CRP, high-level TNF-?? and high-level IL-6 were significantly higher than that in patients with normal levels (P<0.05). Type 2 DM patients with high-level inflammatory cytokines had significantly longer duration of DM, and higher FPG and HbA1c values than those with normal levels (P<0.05). Results also showed that hs-CRP, TNF-?? and IL-6 were positively correlated with FPG, HbA1c and the hypertension grade, and FPG and HbA1c were also positively correlated with the hypertension grade.Logistic regression analysis revealed that hs-CRP, TNF-??, IL-6, the duration of DM, BMI, FPG, HbA1c, TC and LDL had independent values in predicting Type 2 DM combined with hypertension (P<0.05).

Conclusions: Levels of serum hs-CRP, TNF-?? and IL-6 are significantly elevated in patients with type 2 DM combined with essential hypertension, which are important factors affecting changes in blood glucose. The higher the level of inflammatory cytokines is, the higher the grade of hypertension will be."
20,Comparison of the Suitability of 2 Years Change in Waist Circumference and Body Mass Index in Predicting Hypertension Risk: A Prospective Study in Chinese-Han,2014 Sep;43(9):1212-20.,Iran J Public Health,Wenshu Luo,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4500423/,"Background: Currently, obesity has become a worldwide health problem and yet little is known about the impact of changes in obesity indicator on incident hypertension. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of changes in the WC and BMI on incident hypertension in a cohort population.

Methods: After a baseline investigation, we conducted the first and the second follow-up assessments for subjects after 2 and 5 years, respectively. The associations between the changes in the WC and BMI (measured as the D-value, i.e., the value at the first follow-up minus the value at baseline) and the hazard ratio (HR) of incident hypertension were analyzed with a multilevel Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Results: Among 2778 participants without hypertension, 660 developed hypertension between the first and the second follow-up assessments. When both the BMI and WC D-values were included in the regression model, the WC D-value was a predictor of hypertension incidence in both sexes (OR= 1.03 and P values < 0.05 for men and women), but the BMI D-value was no longer a predictor of hypertension incidence in either sex (OR=1.04 for men and 1.01 for women, both P values >0.05). In both sexes, hypertension risk was higher for subjects whose BMI was modified but WC was categorically increasing than for subjects whose WC and BMI were both modified.

Conclusions: Both WC and BMI changes were associated with hypertension, but a change in the WC was a better predictor of the hypertension."
21,Associations of short-term weight changes and weight cycling with incidence of essential hypertension in the EPIC-Potsdam Study,2005 Jan;19(1):61-7.,J Hum Hypertens,M Schulz,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.jhh.1001776,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationships of short-term weight gain, weight loss, and weight cycling on the odds of developing hypertension. Normotensive middle-aged German men and women (n=12,362) of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam Study were assigned to categories of 2-year short-term weight changes that were self-reported to have occurred prior to recruitment into the study (gain only, loss only, weight cycling, stable). 
After 2 years of follow-up after recruitment, 180 cases of incident essential hypertension were identified. In logistic regression models, odds ratios were estimated for the associations between short-term weight changes and risk of developing hypertension. Obesity status (BMI>or=30 or BMI<30 kg/m2) modified the associations between short-term weight change and incidence of diagnosed hypertension. Among obese individuals, short-term weight gain occurring during the 2 years prior to recruitment (OR=2.79, 95% CI 1.19-6.56), weight loss (OR=6.74, 95% CI 2.58-17.6) and weight cycling (OR=4.29, 95% CI 1.55-11.9) were strongly positively associated with incident hypertension, adjusted for age and gender, compared to obese individuals with short-term stable weight. No significant associations between short-term weight changes and risk of diagnosed hypertension were detected among non-obese individuals. Short-term weight changes appeared to present strong risk factors for developing hypertension among obese individuals. The effect seen for weight cycling supports the hypothesis that weight cycling increases the risk of hypertension. The finding for short-term weight loss may be explained by subsequent weight regain and needs further investigation."
22,N-glycosylation of immunoglobulin G predicts incident hypertension,2021 Dec 1;39(12):2527-2533.,J Hypertens,Domagoj Kifer,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000002963,"Objectives: Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) is an important regulator of the immune system and has been implicated in prevalent hypertension. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the IgG glycome begins to change prior to hypertension diagnosis by analysing the IgG glycome composition in a large population-based female cohort with two independent replication samples.

Methods: We included 989 unrelated cases with incident hypertension and 1628 controls from the TwinsUK cohort (mean follow-up time of 6.3 years) with IgG measured at baseline by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and longitudinal BP measurement available. We replicated our findings in 106 individuals from the 10 001 Dalmatians and 729 from KORA S4. Cox regression mixed models were applied to identify changes in glycan traits preincident hypertension, after adjusting for age, mean arterial pressure, BMI, family relatedness and multiple testing (FDR < 0.1). Significant IgG-incident hypertension associations were replicated in the two independent cohorts by leveraging Cox regression mixed models in the 10 001 Dalmatians and logistic regression models in the KORA cohort.

Results: We identified and replicated four glycan traits, incidence of bisecting GlcNAc, GP4, GP9 and GP21, that are predictive of incident hypertension after adjusting for confoundes and multiple testing [hazard ratio (95% CI) ranging from 0.45 (0.24-0.84) for GP21 to 2.9 (1.5-5.68) for GP4]. We then linearly combined the four replicated glycans and found that the glycan score correlated with incident hypertension, SBP and DBP.

Conclusion: Our results suggest that the IgG glycome changes prior to the development of hypertension."
23,Presence and progression of abdominal obesity are predictors of future high blood pressure and hypertension,2006 Aug;19(8):788-95.,Am J Hypertens,Shao-Yuan Chuang,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjhyper.2006.01.010,"Background: General obesity and its progression are major predictors of future hypertension. It has not been established whether abdominal obesity contributes to the development of hypertension.
Methods: A community-based study population of 2377 normotensive nondiabetic Chinese adults aged >or=30 years were re-examined 10 years after their baseline examination.
Results: The 10-year cumulative incidence of hypertension was 25.9%. The standardized parameters for the prediction of follow-up systolic blood pressure (BP) for baseline body mass index (BMI), change in BMI, baseline homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), change in HOMA-IR, baseline waist circumference (WC), and change in WC were 0.19 (P < .001), 0.09 (P < .001), 0.11 (P < .001), 0.08 (P < .001), 0.16 (P < .001), and 0.07 (P < .001), respectively, when age, sex, and baseline systolic BP were accounted for. By stepwise linear regression analysis, age, baseline systolic BP, baseline BMI, change in BMI, baseline WC, and change in WC were significant predictors of the follow-up systolic BP. Both baseline WC and change in WC were significant predictors of follow-up systolic BP or incident hypertension when age, sex, baseline systolic BP, BMI, and change in BMI were accounted for. In a subgroup of younger adults with normal BMI and BP<130/85 mm Hg, baseline systolic BP, change in HOMA-IR, baseline WC, and change in WC were significantly independent predictors of follow-up systolic BP.
Conclusion: Abdominal obesity and its progression are predictors of future BP and hypertension incidence, independent of the effects of general obesity."
24,[Impact of dynamic change of waist circumference or body mass index in hypertension incidence],2011 Nov;45(11):1012-6.,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Wen-shu Luo,,"Objective: To study the impact of dynamic change of waist circumference (WC) and body mass index(BMI) in two years on hypertension incidence in cohort populations.
Methods: A perspective cohort study was conducted. The participants (5888 subjects) whose follow-time were 2 years or longer from the program Prevention of multiple metabolic disorders and metabolic syndrome (MS) in Jiangsu province were investigated. Amongst 5888 subjects, 4582 participants received the first follow-up investigation in January 2002. Among 4582 subjects who received first follow-up investigation and whose follow-time met 5 years, total 3847 participants received the second follow-up investigation in March 2006. Total 2778 free hypertension subjects were included in this analysis. Subjects with normal WC or BMI at baseline but abnormal WC or BMI at the first follow-up or subjects with abnormal WC or BMI both at baseline and the first follow-up were defined as non-control group. Subjects with abnormal WC or BMI at baseline but normal WC or BMI at the first follow-up or subjects with normal WC or BMI both at baseline and the first follow-up were defined as control group. The incidence of hypertension at second follow-up investigation was defined as the final variable(hypertension = 1, non-hypertension = 0). The association between dynamic change of WC or BMI and incident hypertension was analyzed by using Cox proportional hazards regression model. The OR, RR value and 95%CI were calculated through WC and BMI risk stratification.

Results: Among 2778 participants without hypertension at baseline, 660 subjects developed hypertension. When both BMI difference value (D-value) and WC D-value were included in the regression model, WC D-value was associated with hypertension in both genders (males: OR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.01 - 1.05; females: OR = 1.04, 95%CI: 1.02 - 1.06), but BMI D-value was not associated with hypertension in both men and women (males: OR = 1.04, 95%CI: 0.97 - 1.11; females: OR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.93 - 1.03). Hypertension risk of WC non-control group was higher than that in WC control group in baseline normal and abnormal WC groups (normal baseline WC group: RR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.01 - 2.39, abnormal baseline WC group: RR = 4.41, 95%CI: 1.66 - 9.80). But in baseline abnormal BMI group, there was no significant difference between BMI control and non-control group (RR = 1.33, 95%CI: 0.88 - 2.02). Whether BMI was controlled can not influence hypertension risk if WC was controlled (males: RR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.36 - 2.96; females: RR = 1.02, 95%CI: 0.70 - 5.85), however, control WC could reduce hypertension risk obviously even though BMI was not controlled (males: RR = 4.03, 95%CI: 1.61 - 10.09; females: RR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.13 - 3.60).
Conclusion: Both WC and BMI dynamic change were associated with change of hypertension. But reducing WC can decrease hypertension risk more than reducing BMI."
25,Biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction as predictors of pulse pressure and incident hypertension in type 1 diabetes: a 20 year life-course study in an inception cohort,2018 Jan;61(1):231-241.,Diabetologia,Isabel Ferreira,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-017-4470-5,"Aims/hypothesis: Vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are thought to contribute to arterial stiffening and hypertension. This study aims to test this hypothesis with longitudinal data in the context of type 1 diabetes.

Methods: We investigated, in an inception cohort of 277 individuals with type 1 diabetes, the course, tracking and temporal inter-relationships of BP, specifically pulse pressure (a marker of arterial stiffening) and hypertension, and the following biomarkers of systemic and vascular inflammation/endothelial dysfunction: C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin). These biomarkers and other risk factors were measured at baseline and repeatedly up to 20 years after the onset of type 1 diabetes. Data were analysed with generalised estimating equations including adjustments for age, sex, smoking status, BMI, HbA1c, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, urinary AER, insulin treatment dose and mean arterial pressure.

Results: Increases were noted in all biomarkers except sE-selectin, which decreased over time. Levels differed from baseline at 2-4 years and preceded the increase in pulse pressure, which occurred at 8-10 years after the onset of type 1 diabetes. Higher levels of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, but not CRP or sE-selectin, at baseline and throughout the 20 year follow-up, were significantly associated with higher (changes in) pulse pressure at subsequent time points. Higher levels of sVCAM-1 at baseline and during follow-up were also significantly associated with the prevalence (OR 3.60 [95% CI 1.36, 9.53] and OR 2.28 [1.03, 5.25], respectively) and incidence (OR 2.89 [1.08, 7.75] and OR 3.06 [1.01, 9.26], respectively) of hypertension. We also investigated the longitudinal associations between BP or hypertension as determinants of subsequent (changes in) levels of CRP, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin, but did not find evidence to support a reverse causality hypothesis.

Conclusions/interpretation: These findings support the involvement of vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in the development of premature arterial stiffening and hypertension in type 1 diabetes."
26,Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill-Induced Hypertension and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: Shared Mechanisms and Clinical Similarities,2021 May 13;23(5):29.,Curr Hypertens Rep,Madugodaralalage D S K Gunaratne,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-021-01147-4,"Purpose of review: Oral contraceptive pill-induced hypertension (OCPIH) and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) share common risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms, yet the bidirectional relationship between these two conditions is not well-established. We review and describe OCPIH and HDP to better understand how hormonal and metabolic imbalances affect hypertension.
Recent findings: Oral contraceptive pills continue to be a popular method of contraception, with an incidence of OCPIH ranging from 1-8.5% among OCP users. HDP have an incidence of 5-10% of all pregnancies in the USA and have been shown to be a powerful predictor of lifetime adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including future hypertension. OCPIH and HDP share common risk factors such as age, BMI, past personal and family history of hypertension, as well as pathogenic mechanisms, including alterations in hormonal metabolism and the renin angiotensin aldosterone system; imbalance of vasodilator-vasoconstrictor compounds; and changes in the cardiovascular system. Future research should address additional potential mechanisms that underlie hypertension in these two conditions where endocrine changes, either physiological (pregnancy) or iatrogenic (use of OCP), play a role. This may lead to novel, targeted treatment options to improve hypertension management and overall cardiovascular risk profile management in this subset of young female patients."
27,Body fat distribution and hypertension incidence in women and men. The NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study,1998 Feb;22(2):127-34.,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,R F Gillum,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.0800554,"Objective: To test the hypothesis that an elevated ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness (SFR), one measure of truncal obesity, is associated with increased incidence of essential hypertension.
Design: Data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) were analyzed.
Subjects: A cohort of 4303 women and 2579 men with complete data who were normotensive at baseline in 1971-1975.
Measurements: Incidence of hypertension, blood pressure 160/95 mm Hg or greater or on blood pressure medication at follow-up in 1982-1984.
Results: There was a statistically significant increase in risk of hypertension over approximately 10 y follow-up in white women aged 25-74 y with SFR in the fifth compared to the first quintile independent of age and body mass index (BMI) (relative risk = 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.13-2.06, P = 0.006). The association was somewhat diminished after controlling for baseline blood pressure, change in BMI and other risk variables. An even stronger association was seen for subscapular skinfold and hypertension incidence. In white men aged 25-74 y, a significant association of high SFR with age-, BMI-adjusted risk of hypertension was seen (RR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.96, P = 0.04). Data for black women or black men failed to reveal significant variation in hypertension risk among quintiles of SFR or subscapular skinfold except in black women with low baseline BMI.
Conclusions: Data from NHEFS confirm the association of higher truncal obesity with increased incidence of hypertension in white women. Further studies are needed, especially in larger samples of black women."
28,"Metabolic syndrome, not menopause, is a risk factor for hypertension in peri-menopausal women",2018 Oct 15;24:14.,Clin Hypertens,Gyu Chul Oh,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40885-018-0099-z,"Background: It has been long debated whether menopause itself is a risk factor for hypertension in peri-menopausal women. We aimed to assess the association between menopause and hypertension, and whether metabolic syndrome (MetS) has an influence on its effect.
Methods: Data for 1502 women aged 42 to 53 from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) database were retrospectively analyzed. The KoGES database consists of 10,038 participants, of which 52.6% (5275) were female. Subjects were followed up for 4 years, and compared according to menopausal status. Additionally, 1216 non-hypertensive subjects were separately analyzed to assess whether a change in menopausal status was associated with development of hypertension.

Results: The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and MetS for menopausal and non-menopausal subjects at baseline was 24.4% vs. 16.7%, 5.8% vs. 2.9%, and 25.4% vs. 16.6%, respectively (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Among non-hypertensive subjects at baseline, prevalence of hypertension at 4-year follow-up was 9.4%, 19.7%, and 13.1% for non-menopausal, those who became menopause during follow-up, and those who were menopause at baseline, respectively. Development of hypertension was positively correlated with MetS (HR 3.90, 95% CI 2.51-6.07) and increased BMI (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16), while association with menopause was not significant.

Conclusions: Menopause is closely associated with increased incidence of hypertension, but the increase may not be attributable to menopause itself but to increased prevalence of MetS."
29,"Gamma-glutamyltransferase, fatty liver index and hepatic insulin resistance are associated with incident hypertension in two longitudinal studies",2017 Mar;35(3):493-500.,J Hypertens,Fabrice Bonnet,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000001204,"Objective: We hypothesized that liver markers and the fatty liver index (FLI) are predictive of incident hypertension and that hepatic insulin resistance plays a role.
Methods: The association between liver markers and incident hypertension was analysed in two longitudinal studies of normotensive individuals, 2565 from the 9-year data from an epidemiological study on the insulin resistance cohort and the 321 from the 3-year 'Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease' cohort who had a measure of endogenous glucose production. The FLI is calculated from BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and the hepatic insulin resistance index from endogenous glucose production and fasting insulin.
Results: The incidence of hypertension increased across the quartiles groups of both baseline GGT and alanine aminotransferase. After adjustment for sex, age, waist circumference, fasting glucose, smoking and alcohol intake, only GGT was significantly related with incident hypertension [standardized odds ratio: 1.21; 95% confidence interval (1.10-1.34); P = 0.0001]. The change in GGT levels over the follow-up was also related with an increased risk of hypertension, independently of changes in body weight. FLI analysed as a continuous value, or FLI at least 60 at baseline were predictive of incident hypertension in the multivariable model. In the RISC cohort, the hepatic insulin resistance index was positively related with the risk of 3-year incident hypertension [standardized odds ratio: 1.54 (1.07-2.22); P = 0.02].
Conclusion: Baseline GGT and FLI, as well as an increase in GGT over time, were associated with the risk of incident hypertension. Enhanced hepatic insulin resistance predicted the onset of hypertension and may be a link between liver markers and hypertension."
30,[Association between body mass index and ten-year-accumulative-risk of hypertension],2009 May;30(5):435-8.,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,Dong Zhao,,"Objective: To explore the association between body mass index (BMI) and ten-year accumulative risk of hypertension.
Methods: A prospective study of relationship between blood pressure and other traditional risk factors was carried out in a cohort with 2115 people aged 35-64 years old involved, in 1992 and 2002. The association between baseline BMI level and a ten-year accumulative risk of hypertension was analyzed.
Results: The ten-year accumulative incidence rate of hypertension was 34.8%, and increased with the elevated baseline BMI level in both genders (P < 0.001). Similar changing trends were observed in both age groups of 45-54 year and 55-64 year olds (P < 0.05). Multivariable OR (95% CI) of accumulative incident hypertension in the highest BMI tertile ( > or =28 kg/m2) was 3.569 higher (2.559 to 4.977) when compared to the lowest ( <24 kg/m2n). The ten-year accumulative risk of hypertension increased 17.5% with elevation of baseline BMI level by 1 kg/m2. The ten-year accumulative incidence rate of hypertension was 22.0% in the subjects with normal BMI and 56.3% in those with obesity, both in 1992 and 2002.
Conclusion: BMI appeared to be an independent risk factor for hypertension, and the risk of incident hypertension increased with elevated BMI level."
31,Risk of progression to hypertension across baseline blood pressure in nonhypertensive participants among rural Chinese adults: a prospective study,2010 Jun;28(6):1158-65.,J Hypertens,Liqiang Zheng,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0b013e3283378568,"Objectives: To assess the risk of progression to hypertension across baseline blood pressure (BP) level among rural Chinese adults.
Methods: A population-based sample of 24 052 rural Chinese adults aged at least 35 years and free from hypertension at baseline were followed up from 2004-2006 to 2008. Incident hypertension was defined as SBP of at least 140 mmHg, DBP of at least 90 mmHg, current use of antihypertensive medication, or all.

Results: During a median follow-up of 28 months, 26.5% participants developed clinical hypertension, most of which were untreated and uncontrolled. The cumulative incidence of hypertension in participants with optimal, normal, and high-normal BP was 21.2, 25.2, and 32.4%, respectively. The higher incidence of hypertension (per 100 person-years) was obviously observed in higher BP category at baseline among both older and younger groups (both P for trend <0.05). Compared with optimal BP, the adjusted hazard ratios of participants with normal and high-normal BP for incident hypertension were 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.24) and 1.28 (95% confidence interval 1.20-1.36), respectively. In addition, older age, men, Mongolian ethnicity, alcohol drinking, family history of hypertension, BMI, and change in BMI during follow-up were also independently associated with incident hypertension.

Conclusion: There was a stepwise increase in risk of progression to hypertension across baseline BP level. This information could help us define a population at high risk of progression to hypertension, to underscore the importance of frequent BP monitoring, and early interventions in rural Chinese adults."
32,Cardiovascular-sleep interaction in drug-na??ve patients with essential grade I hypertension,2013 Mar;30(1-2):31-42.,Chronobiol Int,Daniela Grimaldi,https://doi.org/10.3109/07420528.2012.701139,"Lack of nighttime blood pressure (BP) reduction by 10-20% from the mean daytime values (dipping) has been described as a distinguishing feature of essential hypertension and associated, also in normotensive subjects, with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Mechanisms involved in the loss of the nocturnal dip are still unclear, but involvement of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity probably plays a crucial role. Sleep is fundamental in modulating ANS activity to maintain the physiological BP circadian rhythm, and for this reason its integrity has been widely investigated in hypertension. We investigated, under controlled conditions, the autonomic control of the CV system through an autonomic reflex screen in the awake condition and by assessment of circadian rhythm-, day-night-, time-, and state-dependent changes of BP and heart rate (HR) and associated sleep parameters in patients with a recent (???1 yr) diagnosis of essential grade I hypertension na??ve of therapy. Fourteen hypertensive patients (6 males, age: 43 ?? 11 yrs; body mass index [BMI]: 24 ?? 3 kg/m(2)) were compared with 28 healthy controls matched for sex, age, BMI (2 controls/patient) for cardiovascular reflex and to 8 different subjects from previous controls (6 males), comparable for age and BMI, for the day-night and nighttime CV profiles during two consecutive nights. The cardiovascular reflex screen data showed increased sympathetic effect in hypertensive patients, represented by higher overshoot of BP after Valsalva maneuver. Nighttime sleep architecture during the dark period in terms of duration, representation of sleep stages, sleep fragmentation, and incidence of arousals-periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) and PLMS arousals-was similar in patients and controls. Hypertensive patients displayed higher 24-h BP and HR values, but their sleep-related BP decrease was significantly reduced compared with controls. The circadian rhythms of BP and HR were intact and similar in patients and controls, coupling with the expected physiological peak time. BP and HR showed normal state-dependent modulation in hypertensive patients that, however, was higher in all sleep stages compared with controls. The lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages 1 and 2 and REM sleep, relative to daytime wake values, was significantly attenuated in the hypertensive group, whereas it was comparable to controls during slow-wave sleep. In hypertensive patients, analysis of sleep and CV parameters in the 90 min following sleep onset and preceding morning awakening showed normal depressor effect during the first part of the night after sleep onset and significantly higher BP rise in the hours preceding morning awakening. These findings were associated with comparable sleep architecture, sleep fragmentation, incidence of arousals, and PLMS and PLMS arousals in patients and controls. Our data suggest that drug-na??ve essential grade I hypertension is associated with signs of increased vascular sympathetic response to standardized stress of the Valsalva maneuver during the awake condition, and during sleep with a non-dipping BP profile plus higher BP surge preceding morning awakening, assessable only by around-the-clock ambulatory BP monitoring, both representing additional CV risk already in early-stage hypertension and, therefore, requiring proper selection of pharmacological treatment."
33,Health-related quality of life and risk of hypertension in the community: prospective results from the Western New York Health Study,2015 Apr;33(4):720-6; discussion 726.,J Hypertens,Saverio Stranges,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000000465,"Objectives: Measures of health-related quality of life (HRQL) are strong predictors of health outcomes including cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, prospective evidence on the potential impact of these measures on hypertension risk is scant. We therefore examined the independent role of HRQL on the risk of hypertension in a 6-year longitudinal investigation among 979 women and men (mean age 54.3 years) from the community, who were free of hypertension, CVD and diabetes at the baseline examination.

Methods: Baseline variables included socio-demographics, anthropometrics, blood pressure, behavioural risk factors and measures of HRQL, such as the physical and mental health component summaries of the short form-36 questionnaire (SF-36). Incident hypertension was defined as blood pressure at least 140/90 mmHg or on antihypertensive medication at the follow-up visit.

Results: The cumulative 6-year incidence of hypertension was 21.9% (214/979). In bivariate analyses, there were several baseline correlates of incident hypertension, including age, abdominal height, BMI and baseline blood pressure levels in both sexes, whereas impaired fasting glucose, family history of hypertension and the SF-36 physical score were all significantly associated with hypertension among women only. After multivariate adjustment, the SF-36 physical scores [odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 0.94-0.99 for unit change] were still significant predictors of hypertension in women only, independent of age, anthropometrics, baseline SBP levels, behavioural risk factors and other covariates.

Conclusion: Measures of HRQL may represent independent predictors of hypertension risk, at least among women, above and beyond the role of traditional risk factors, such as age, anthropometrics and genetic predisposition."
34,Risk of progression to hypertension in a rural Chinese women population with prehypertension and normal blood pressure,2010 Jun;23(6):627-32.,Am J Hypertens,Zhaoqing Sun,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2010.41,"Background: To determine the incidence of hypertension and its risk factors among rural Chinese women with prehypertension and normotension.
Methods: A population-based sample of 12,060 rural Chinese women aged > or = 35 years and free from hypertension at baseline were followed from 2004-2006 to 2008. Incident hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 90 mm Hg, or current use of antihypertensive medication.

Results: Over a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 14-47 months), 23.4% of women developed hypertension. The age-adjusted incidence rate was higher in prehypertension than in normotension (11.2/100 person-years vs. 7.9/100 person-years, P < 0.05). Among women with prehypertension, independent predictors of incident hypertension were baseline age, Mongolian ethnicity, low physical activity, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline salt intake and family history of hypertension. Among women with normal blood pressure (BP), independent predictors were baseline age, low physical activity, baseline BMI and baseline salt intake. The awareness, treatment, and control rates for newly developed hypertension were 33.2, 23.0, and 2.1%, respectively.

Conclusions: These data indicate that the incidence of hypertension is high among rural Chinese women and it is associated with many risk factors, and the data also suggest that most newly developed hypertension cases are not treated. This high incidence of hypertension may be related to rapid social changes in our country and may apply to other areas of the developing world. These results call for urgent improvements in hypertension prevention, detection and treatment."
35,C-reactive protein implications in new-onset hypertension in a healthy population initially aged 65 years: the Proof study,2009 Apr;27(4):736-43.,J Hypertens,Virginie Dauphinot,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0b013e328326f801,"Background: Because inflammation is known to be related with several cardiovascular diseases, we sought to determine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) might precede the onset of hypertension.

Methods: The study population was selected from the Proof study cohort including 1011 individuals initially aged 65 years at baseline and followed for 7 years. CRP, ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) and casual blood pressure were repeatedly measured during examination. Normotensive individuals were selected according to different measurements of blood pressure, self-reported history of hypertension and use of antihypertensive treatment.

Results: Among 335 individuals, considered normotensive at baseline with ABPM (threshold 135/85 mmHg), with no history of hypertension and no use of antihypertensive treatment, the incidence of hypertension was 9.9% 2 years later. The 2-year risk for new-onset hypertension was 18% greater for 1 mg/l increment of CRP (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.39). This relationship remained after adjustment for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, BMI and change in CRP between the two examinations but not after adjustment for 24-h systolic ABPM. Among the 160 individuals considered normotensive at baseline with an additional criterion (casual blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg), the incidence of hypertension was 26.9% 2 years later. The 2-year risk for new-onset hypertension was 52% greater for 1 mg/l increment of CRP (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.96) after adjustment for systolic ABPM, change in CRP and BMI.

Conclusion: An elevated baseline CRP value precedes new-onset hypertension at an early stage among an elderly healthy population. Whether CRP measurement can ease the detection of patients likely to develop clinical hypertension remains to be determined."
36,[A four-year prospective study of the relationship between body mass index and waist circumstances and hypertension in Chinese adults],2007 Jul;36(4):478-80.,Wei Sheng Yan Jiu,Yuan Li,,"Objective: To explore whether the increase of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumstances (WC) can predict the higher risk of hypertension in Chinese adults.
Methods: The data were collected in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). A total of 4552 adults aged 18-60 years old were selected as the subjects who were healthy in the baseline survey in 2000 and followed up in 2004. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of developing hypertension associated with the BMI and WC in baseline and the four-year change of BMI and WC.

Results: The incidence of hypertension of men and women was 20.01% and 13.52% respectively during the four years of follow-up. The risk of developing hypertension rose with the increase of either BMI or WC in baseline. Compared with the group of neither general obesity (defined by BMI) nor abdominal obesity (defined by WC) group with both general obesity and abdominal obesity had the highest risk (men RR = 2.840, 95% CI: 2.139-3.771, women RR = 2.734, 95% CI: 2.050-3.647) among the different combinations of BMI and WC. Adjusted for other factors the risk of developing hypertension also increased with the four-year augment of either BMI or WC (BMI: men, RR = 1.141, 95% CI: 1.087-1.199, women, RR = 1.109, 95% CI: 1.056-1.164, WC: men, RR = 1.038, 95% CI: 1.022-1.055, women, RR = 1.035, 95% CI: 1.018-1.052).

Conclusion: The increase of BMI and WC can predict the higher risk of the development of hypertension. The combination of BMI and WC can increase the predictive efficacy of the incidence of hypertension."

Design: Longitudinal closed cohort studied over an average of 6 y.
Subjects: Total of 9309 white and African-American men and women 45-64 y of age who participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.

Methods: Weight and blood pressure were measured at baseline and after an average of 3 and 6 y of follow-up. Proportional hazard models with weight gain as a time-dependent variable were used to examine the association between weight gain and changes in blood pressure and hypertension. Multivariate models were used with baseline SBP, DBP, age, BMI, height, WHR, smoking, physical activity, education, caloric intake, fat intake and study center as covariates.

Results: Weight gain was associated with increases in SBP and DBP in all groups. Hazard ratios for hypertension associated with 1 kg annual weight gain were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.29, 1.45) in white women, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03, 1.21) in African-American women, 1.35 (95% CI, 1.27, 1.43) in white men and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.27,1.61) in African-American men.

Conclusion: Weight gain was associated with increased blood pressure and increased incidence of hypertension. The association was weaker among African-American women 
compared to other ethnicity-gender groups."
38,Association of benign intracranial hypertension and spontaneous encephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid leak,2012 Dec;33(9):1621-4.,Otol Neurotol,Laura Brainard,https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0b013e318271c312,"Objective: To determine the incidence of intracranial hypertension in patients with spontaneous encephalocele with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.
Study design: Retrospective case review.
Setting: Tertiary care neurotology practice.
Patients: Patients presenting between 2008 and 2011 with spontaneous encephalocele and CSF leak in the temporal bone.
Intervention(s): Lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement after encephalocele repair.
Main outcome measures: Patient age, sex, postoperative course, body mass index, and postoperative intracranial pressure.

Results: Of the 26 patients identified with spontaneous encephalocele with CSF leak, 9 patients had postoperative lumbar puncture data. Of those 9, 89% were female subjects, and 11% were male, with a mean age of 57 and a mean BMI of 41 kg/m (morbidly obese). The mean opening pressure was 24.5 cm H(2)O. Approximately 33% had normal intracranial pressure (mean, 15 cm H(2)O; range, 10-17 cm H(2)O); 67% had elevated intracranial pressure (mean, 29 cm H(2)O; range, 23.5-40 cm H(2)O). The incidence of BIH in the general population is 0.001%. Of the 6 with intracranial hypertension, 3 (50%) were placed on acetazolamide for fundoscopic findings, postoperative headache, and/or visual changes. Mean time to LP after repair of encephalocele was 13 months (range, 4 days to 75 months).

Conclusion: This study shows that benign intracranial hypertension is prevalent in a significant number of patients presenting with spontaneous encephalocele with CSF otorrhea at a rate much higher than is found in the general population. This finding has direct clinical implications and suggests that all patients with spontaneous encephalocele/CSF leak warrant evaluation for benign intracranial hypertension."
39,Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of hypertension in the obese,1999 Nov;31(11 Suppl):S624-30.,Med Sci Sports Exerc,R H Fagard,https://doi.org/10.1097/00005768-199911001-00022,"Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of hypertension in the obese.
Purpose: The purpose of this paper was to assess the value of physical exercise in the prevention and treatment of hypertension with particular attention to possible interactions with relative weight.

Methods: We describe epidemiological studies and report meta-analyses of randomized intervention trials, i.e., randomized controlled trials on dynamic physical training and randomized comparative trials of exercise and diet.

Results: Epidemiological studies show an inverse relationship between physical activity or fitness and the incidence of hypertension, which was either independent of body size or more pronounced in the overweight. The weighted net reduction of blood pressure in response to dynamic physical training averages 3.4/2.4 mm Hg (P < 0.001), which appears to be unrelated to the initial body mass index (BMI) and to its training-induced changes. Exercise is less effective than diet in lowering blood pressure (P < 0.02), and adding exercise to diet does not appear to further reduce blood pressure. Future studies should observe scientific criteria more strictly, address the truly obese (BMI > or = 30 kg x m(-2)) and attempt to resolve the blood pressure lowering mechanisms.
Conclusion: Physical activity contributes to the control of blood pressure in overweight as well as in lean subjects."
40,Predictors of hypertension and changes of blood pressure in HIV-infected patients,2005;10(7):811-23.,Antivir Ther,Rodolphe Thi??baut,,"Objective: We assessed predictors of changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure during follow-up and of the development of hypertension in HIV-infected individuals.

Methods: International cohort collaborative study (D:A:D) of established prospective cohorts of HIV-1-infected patients. Longitudinal analysis of changes in blood pressure (BP) was performed using mixed effects models in 17170 patients. Predictors of development of hypertension during follow-up (systolic BP > or =140 and/or diastolic BP > or =90 mmHg or initiation of antihypertensive treatment) were assessed using Cox models in 8 984 patients with a normal BP level at baseline.
Results: 73548 BP measurements with a median of 4 per patient (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-6) were recorded over a median follow-up of 2.3 years (IQR: 1.5-2.6). Risk factors significantly associated with a development of higher systolic BP and diastolic BP (differences > or =5 mmHg and P-values <0.001) during follow-up were: older age, male sex, higher body mass index (BMI) and use of BP-lowering drugs. In patients with normal BP at baseline, 1186 developed hypertension for an incidence of 72.1 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval: 68.2-76.0). Factors associated with development of hypertension were: male sex, higher BMI, older age, higher BP at baseline, high total cholesterol and clinical lipodystrophy. Cumulative duration of exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (P=0.75), protease inhibitors (P=0.92) as well as type of antiretroviral treatment at baseline (P=0.18) were not associated with a higher risk of hypertension. Cumulative duration of exposure to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was significantly associated with lower risk of hypertension (hazard ratio=0.78 and 0.67 for those treated < or =10 months and >10 months compared with no exposure; P=0.005).

Conclusions: Increased blood pressure in HIV-infected individuals is associated with established risk factors for hypertension. There was no evidence for an independent deleterious effect of any class of antiretroviral drugs on BP, although the use of NNRTIs was associated with a lower risk of development of hypertension."
41,Increases in job strain are associated with incident hypertension in the CARDIA Study,2004 Aug;28(1):4-9.,Ann Behav Med,Jerome H Markovitz,https://doi.org/10.1207/s15324796abm2801_2,"Background: Job strain, defined as high job demands and low decision latitude, has been associated with increased blood pressure levels in some studies, but most of these studies have been cross-sectional.
Purpose: We sought to determine whether changes in job strain during young adulthood were associated with the development of hypertension, using the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort.

Methods: A total of 3,200 employed, initially normotensive participants, aged 20 to 32 in 1987-1988, were followed for 8 years; the Job Content Questionnaire was completed twice: initially and 8 years later. Hypertension at follow-up was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160 or higher and diastolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg or higher, or reporting being on antihypertensive medication.

Results: Job strain (based on job demands above the median and decision latitude below the median of the sample) was associated with hypertension incidence (ps <.05) for the entire cohort and among White women and men. Adjustment for baseline SBP, education, body mass index (BMI), change in BMI, and age did not alter these relations. The ratio of increasing demands relative to decreasing decision latitude was also associated with greater incidence of hypertension in the entire cohort in the multivariate model (odds ratio = 2.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-4.26).

Conclusions: An increase in job strain is associated with incident hypertension, particularly among Whites."
42,"The Olivetti Heart Study: Predictive value of a new adiposity index on risk of hypertension, blood pressure, and subclinical organ damage",2016 Jul;26(7):630-636.,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,L D'Elia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2016.03.009,"Background and aims: Recently, some studies have indicated that a new anthropometric index, body adiposity index (BAI), could be more strongly correlated with the percentage of body fat than BMI. However, the results on its role in predicting cardiovascular risk were not univocal. Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare the predictive role of BMI and BAI on risk of hypertension (HP), blood pressure (BP) changes, and subclinical organ damage after an 8-year follow-up, in a sample of adult men participating in the Olivetti Heart Study.

Methods and results: Participants were 350 untreated normotensive men without diabetes, examined twice at baseline (1994-95) and after 8 years of follow-up [2002-04]. BMI was expressed as kg/m(2). BAI was calculated according to the following formula: [(hip circumference (cm)/height(1.5) (m)) - 18]. Subclinical organ damage was detected by urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and left ventricular mass, evaluated by the Cornell product (CP). At baseline, BAI and BMI were both associated with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). After 8 years, both baseline BAI and BMI were associated with changes (??) in systolic BP, MAP and pulse pressure, while only BMI was also positively related to ??DBP. Analysis of HP incidence showed that both indices were significant predictors of HP. In addition, both BAI and BMI were significantly associated with ??UAE, but not with ??CP. Analysis of the changes in BAI and BMI confirmed these results, as the two indices were significantly associated with risk of HP and changes in BP and UAE, but not with changes in CP.

Conclusions: In this sample of healthy adult men, BAI and BMI were significant predictors of risk of HP and changes in BP, after an 8-years follow-up. In addition both indices predicted UAE changes, but neither was associated with the CP changes."
43,Effect of Bariatric Surgery on the Cardiovascular System in Obese Cases with Pulmonary Hypertension,2021 Feb;31(2):523-530.,Obes Surg,Ahmed Abdallah Salman,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04852-2,"Introduction and aim: Recently, the incidence of obesity has been rising exponentially. Clinical studies have demonstrated that different subtypes of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are linked to obesity. The current work mainly aims to assess the impact of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on PH in a cohort of obese cases.
Patients and methods: The present prospective work included 37 obese cases with PH for whom LSG was done. Only cases with PH and presurgical right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) ??? 35 mmHg using Doppler echocardiogram were enrolled. Fifteen months later, patients were reassessed regarding new weight and BMI in addition to changes in RVSP.

Results: At the end of follow-up, the average BMI improved from 45.8 + 3.9 to 33.8 + 2.5 Kg/m2 (p value < 0.001). Improved right ventricular (RV) size compared to baseline echo was observed in 20 patients. RV size decreased from 2.68 + 0.44 cm to 2.34 + 0.36 cm (p value < 0.001). Notable decrease of PH to less than 30 mmHg occurred in 33 patients. Mean RVSP decreased from 39.62 + 2.1 to 31.81 + 3.1 mmHg (p value < 0.001). LSG significantly decreased the requirements for PH drugs and supplemental oxygen therapy.

Conclusion: The current work suggests that LSG-induced weight loss may result in a considerable decrease in pulmonary pressures as well as RV size with a concurrent resolution of other metabolic comorbidities."

CHD risk factors of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), obesity and hypertension were investigated by community based survey among a bedouin-derived Emirati population sample of 322 subjects (> or = 20 years). Diagnosis of diabetes was based on a random capillary blood glucose level > or = 11.1 mmol l-1. Overall diabetes prevalence was 6% (11% in male and 7% in female subjects aged 30-64 years). Urban residence was associated with higher blood glucose levels (P = 0.000), and with higher Body Mass Index (BMI) values (P = 0.002): 27% of all urban residents were obese (BMI > or = 30). The Shamsi were positively associated with higher blood glucose levels compared with other tribal groups (P = 0.000). Female gender was associated with higher BMI values (P = 0.000). Between 19 and 25% of all subjects (male or female; urban or rural residents) have systolic hypertension (> 140 mm Hg). Male gender was associated with raised diastolic BP (P = 0.023). Diabetes was associated with higher mean systolic (P = 0.0274) and diastolic (P = 0.0132) BP levels. Differences in lifestyle between urban and rural residents are becoming blurred with further socioeconomic development and it is expected that the incidence of these CHD risk factors will continue to rise. Further studies are needed to specify changes associated with urbanization. Tribal influence also merits further study given the tradition of consanguinity in the UAE and the genetic basis to NIDDM."
45,[Analysis on essential hypertension risk factors of the high incidence in traffic officers],2008 Nov;37(6):719-22.,Wei Sheng Yan Jiu,Baoying Liu,,"Objective: To study on essential hypertension risk factors of the high incidence in traffic officers. In order to provide evidence for prevention and control of hypertension.
Methods: 139 out of all male marshals who had been serving more than 3 years in a certain railway were studied as occupational crowds of high prevalence rate in essential hypertension (Prevalence rate was 41.7%); 306 male train crew who had similar conditions in seniority and age with the marshals from two sections of this railway were studied by cluster random sampling as occupational crowds of low prevalence rate (Prevalence rate was 21.9%). They were surveyed the common risk factors for hypertension, occupational factors, occupational stress and type A behavior by the health questionnaire designed uniformly. Their lipids and blood glucose were detected. The cause for hypertension were compared in the differences and characteristics.
Results: (1) The risk factors and exposure of essential hypertension in the high incidence in the marshals were more higher than those in the low incidence in crew, and the exposure rate of the risk factors grew faster in the marshals than in the crew with working age. (2) By the same exposure rate of the risk factors in the marshal were more higher risk than those of the crew. (3) The risk factors and the danger lever were different in these two groups. The occupational stress, BMI, drinking habits and working age were the main risky factors, their ROR followed by 3.65, 3.33, 2.56 and 2.64, in the marshals. Hyperlipemia, elevated triglyceride, elevated cholesterol, ages and family history of hypertension were the main risk factors, their RR followed by 4.59, 3.38, 3.33, 2.96 and 2.25, in the crew.
Conclusion: The essential hypertension among people worked on the train mainly result from the change and increase of professional social psychic factors and behavial factors as well as the increased sensitivity and responsibility of blood vessel formed in a long-time high exposure to the risk factors."
46,[The assessment of glucose and lipid parameters in children with a positive family history of hypertension],2013 Oct;35(208):196-201.,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Anna Gryko,,"Arterial hypertension in adults is often associated with excess body weight, and lipid or carbohydrate disorders. The incidence of hypertension in children is growing, although its connection with metabolic disorders and family history of hypertension has not been previously understood.
The aim of the study: To evaluate the relationship between a family history of hypertension and metabolic parameters (carbohydrate and lipid metabolism) and anthropometric measurements in children and adolescents.
Material and methods: The study group consists of 40 children (mean age 13.6 years +/-2.7 years) with a positive family history of hypertension, and a comparative group of 44 children with a negative family history of hypertension. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, plasma insulin, glucose, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistants (HOMA IR), and lipid profiles were determined in all children.
Results: Body weight, BMI, WHR, and measurements of skinfolds did not differ significantly between the groups. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the study group (108 vs. 100 Me mmgHg, p = 0.031) Significant differences were observed in the levels of glucose (80 vs. Me. 67 mg/dl, p < 0.001), and insulin (8.89 vs. Me. 5.34 microIU / ml, p = 0.024). The HOMA index showed values significantly higher in the study group (1.68 vs. 0.80 Me p = 0.007). Children with a positive family history of hypertension were characterized by insignificantly higher values of total cholesterol, TG, LDL-cholesterol, and lower HDL-cholesterol.
Conclusions: A positive family history of hypertension correlates with higher systolic blood pressure and changes in carbohydrate metabolism parameters in the direction of the development of insulin resistance in children."
47,Sodium reduction for hypertension prevention in overweight adults: further results from the Trials of Hypertension Prevention Phase II,2005 Jan;19(1):33-45.,J Hum Hypertens,S K Kumanyika,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.jhh.1001774,"Sodium reduction is efficacious for primary prevention of hypertension, but the feasibility of achieving this effect is unclear. The objective of the paper is detailed analyses of adherence to and effects of the sodium reduction intervention among overweight adults in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, Phase II. Sodium reduction (comprehensive education and counselling about how to reduce sodium intake) was tested vs no dietary intervention (usual care) for 36-48 months. A total of 956 white and 203 black adults, ages 30-54 years, with diastolic blood pressure 83-89 mmHg, systolic blood pressure (SBP) <140 mmHg, and body weight 110-165% of gender-specific standard weight were included in the study. At 36 months, urinary sodium excretion was 40.4 mmol/24 h (24.4%) lower in sodium reduction compared to usual care participants (P<0.0001), but only 21% of sodium reduction participants achieved the targeted level of sodium excretion below 80 mmol/24 h. Adherence was positively related to attendance at face-to-face contacts. Net decreases in SBP at 6, 18, and 36 months of 2.9 (P<0.001), 2.0 (P<0.001), and 1.3 (P=0.02) mmHg in sodium reduction vs usual care were associated with an overall 18% lower incidence of hypertension (P=0.048); were relatively unchanged by adjustment for ethnicity, gender, age, and baseline blood pressure, BMI, and sodium excretion; and were observed in both black and white men and women. From these beneficial but modest results with highly motivated and extensively counselled individuals, sodium reduction sufficient to favourably influence the population blood pressure distribution will be difficult to achieve without food supply changes."
48,"Combination therapy versus monotherapy as initial treatment for stage 2 hypertension: a prespecified subgroup analysis of a community-based, randomized, open-label trial",2008 Apr;30(4):661-72.,Clin Ther,Brendan M Everett,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2008.04.013,"Background: Current guidelines suggest consideration of initial combination therapy for patients with stage 2 hypertension, but rates of hypertension treatment and control in clinical practice vary according to age, race, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

Objective: This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of one of the primary efficacy end points-mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 6 weeks -in a previously published community-based, randomized, open-label trial comparing valsartan monotherapy with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination therapy as initial treatment for high-risk patients with stage 2 hypertension.

Methods: Eligible participants with stage 2 hypertension (SBP >or=160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >or=100 mm Hg) were treated with valsartan 160 mg/d or valsartan/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg/d for 2 weeks, followed by forced titration to valsartan 320 mg/d or valsartan/HCTZ 320/12.5 mg/d for an additional 4 weeks. In addition to the primary blood pressure end point (change in SBP at 6 weeks), secondary blood pressure end points at 6 weeks included changes in DBP and the proportion of patients achieving a blood pressure control threshold of <140/90 mm Hg (<130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes), as recommended by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7). The subgroups of interest were women, blacks, Hispanics, the elderly (age >or=65 years), patients with diabetes, smokers, and lean, overweight, and obese subjects (BMI <25, 25-<30, and =30 kg/m(2), respectively).

Results: The randomized trial included 1668 patients (756 [45.3%] female, 392 [23.5%] black, 109 [6.5%] Hispanic, 220 [13.2%] elderly, 970 of 1641 [59.1%] obese, 166 [10.0%] with diabetes, 467 [28.0%] smokers) with stage 2 hypertension. Among those allocated to combination therapy compared with monotherapy, the mean (SD) change in SBP at 6 weeks was -27.4 (18.5) and -19.3 (17.7) mm Hg in women, -21.4 (17.6) and -12.6 (18.5) mm Hg in black subjects, -21.7 (17.6) and -16.3 (16.5) mm Hg in Hispanic subjects, -25.5 (20.2) and -16.9 (17.9) mm Hg in the elderly, and -23.6 (18.1) and -15.9 (16.2) mm Hg in obese subjects. With the exception of the results for Hispanics, all comparisons of combination therapy and monotherapy were statistically significant (P<or=0.01). A higher proportion of those receiving valsartan/ HCTZ compared with valsartan monotherapy reached the JNC 7-defined blood pressure goal (44.5% vs 29.1%, respectively; P<0.001). This pattern was seen consistently in most subgroups analyzed, including men (41.8% vs 27.9%; P<0.001), women (47.8% vs 30.5%; P<0.001), white subjects (46.4% vs 33.8%; P<0.001), black subjects (41.8% vs 19.1%; P<0.001), those aged <65 years (44.6% vs 29.7%; P<0.001), those aged >or=65 years (43.9% vs 24.5%; P=0.004), overweight subjects (49.0% vs 31.2%; P<0.001), and obese subjects (41.4% vs 26.0%; P<0.001). In the entire study cohort, patients assigned to combination therapy had a significantly higher incidence of dizziness compared with those assigned to monotherapy (8.5% vs 4.7%; P=0.002); however, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of adverse events between treatment groups in the prespecified subgroups.

Conclusions: Across various subgroups of patients with stage 2 hypertension, combination therapy was consistently associated with a significantly greater reduction in SBP than monotherapy. With the exception of a significantly greater increase in dizziness compared with monotherapy, combination therapy was well tolerated."

Methods: Data were pooled from three clinical trials evaluating efficacy and tolerability of COER-verapamil. Hypertensive men and women (stage I to III) were randomised to COER-verapamil (180-540 mg at bedtime) or placebo for 4-8 weeks and stratified according to body mass index (BMI-obese > 28 kg/m2). Efficacy was assessed as change from baseline in blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and rate-pressure product during four time periods throughout the dosing interval. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring all adverse events and changes in metabolic laboratory parameters.

Results: Reductions in all haemodynamic parameters were significantly greater following COER-verapamil compared with placebo for all time periods. The haemodynamic effects of COER-verapamil in obese (n = 166, BMI = 32.8 kg/m2) and non-obese patients (n = 115, BMI = 25.0 kg/m2) were similar. COER-verapamil was well tolerated in both subgroups, but the incidence of constipation was significantly less in obese patients (P < 0.001).

Conclusions: COER-verapamil is effective in reducing BP, heart rate, and rate-pressure product independently of BMI."
50,"Risk estimation for hypertension based on follow-up health examination data in a small village in Kumamoto prefecture, Japan",1997 Jan;1(4):206-10.,Environ Health Prev Med,M Shono,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02931218,"The estimation of risk for incidence of hypertension was carried out by follow-up study in a small village in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan (N=750, 48.2??15.2months). 
The most significant risk in both sexes was blood pressure at entry. As for other risks, age, total cholesterol, and BMI in females were significant risks for systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes to greater than the borderline level. 

These factors in males were not significant. From the results of analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model, drinking in males was shown to be a significant risk for diastolic change, and in females for systolic change. It was concluded that excessive drinking in both sexes and obesity in females led to important health problems associated with hypertension among the subjects of the study."
51,Life events and hypertension--a negative finding,1995 Dec;85(12 Pt 2):1346-8.,S Afr Med J,D Edwards,,"Thirty black Xhosa-speaking unskilled workers, aged between 28 and 59 years, completed three questionnaire measures of stress: Bluen and Odesnik's Township Life Events Scale, Weiman's Occupational Stress Scale and Melamed's Emotional Reactivity Scale. Other variables measured were age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body mass index (BMI). Stress levels on all the measures were particularly high in comparison with other groups studied with the same instruments. 

The well-known relationship between body mass and blood pressure was replicated. However, there was no correlation between blood pressure and any of the stress measures, even when variance in respect of age and body mass was partialled out. It is concluded that the pathways linking stressors to high blood pressure are complex and that caution must be exercised in claiming that there is a link between high levels of urban stress and high incidence of hypertension."

The study involved defining the incidence at which these changes occurred between 1981 and 1993 to 1996 in 647 individuals who were free of any disease when initially studied. The study population consisted of approximately 90% of the subjects evaluated in 1981, divided into quartiles on the basis of the plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge as determined in 1981. The results indicated that the 25% of the population with the highest insulin response in 1981 had significant (P < .001) increases in the incidence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes (eightfold), hypertension (twofold), or CHD (threefold). Furthermore, the ability of hyperinsulinemia to predict the three clinical endpoints was independent of differences in age, gender, or body mass index (BMI). Finally, if CHD is considered the clinical endpoint, multiple logistic regression analysis indicates that the values for plasma triglyceride (TG) and mean arterial blood pressure ([MAP] as measured in 1981) also predict the development of CHD. These results indicate that the untoward clinical effects of insulin resistance and/or compensatory hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and CHD clearly can develop in less than 15 years."
53,The study of insulin resistance and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in normotensive adolescents with a family history of hypertension,2009 Jun;23(6):402-6.,J Hum Hypertens,Yin Fu-zai,https://doi.org/10.1038/jhh.2008.146,"To investigate the changes of insulin resistance and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in normotensive adolescents with a family history of hypertension (FH) and to analyse the related factors. The study included 142 normotensive adolescents aged 13-15 years. On the basis of an FH, the samples were divided into positive FH (FH(+) group) and negative FH groups (FH(-) group). 
Anthropometric measurements included height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and blood pressure (BP). Blood samples were collected and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum lipids, true insulin (TI) and sICAM-1 were assayed. The FH(+) group had significantly higher levels of FPG, TI, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and sICAM-1 than the FH(-) group (P<0.01). HOMA-IR showed positive correlation with body mass index (BMI; r=0.405), WC (r=0.416), systolic BP (SBP; r=0.165), FPG (r=0.427), triglyceride (r=0.195), TI (r=0.993) and negative correlation with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=-0.196) (P<0.05). sICAM-1 showed a positive correlation with triglyceride (r=0.239, P<0.01). In multiple linear regression analysis, WC (beta=0.024, P=0.000) and FH (beta=0.467, P=0.000) were significant independent predictors for HOMA-IR, and triglyceride (beta=0.328, P=0.007) and FH (beta=0.395, P=0.016) were significant independent predictors for sICAM-1. These results indicate that insulin resistance and endothelial activation were found in normotensive adolescents with an FH. We should make great efforts to alleviate the insulin resistance and endothelial activation by diet and exercise, and it would reduce the incidence of hypertension in adolescents with an FH."
