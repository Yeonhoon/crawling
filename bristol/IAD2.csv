Mechanical factors such as traumata and friction may aggravate the lesions. The fragile skin in elderly patients is more prone to developing IAD. The clinical picture of IAD consists of persistent redness on the one hand and skin loss on the other. Both categories may be associated with clinical signs of major colonisation or infection. It is important to distinguish IAD from pressure ulcers and other dermatoses in the genital region. Due to the lack of well-established clinical trials, recommendations about prevention and treatment are based on expert opinion and best practice. Gentle cleansing, use of hydrating topical agents and application of barrier products are the main elements in the prevention and treatment of IAD. It is important to translate these recommendations and general guidelines into ready-to-use protocols that can be implemented for each specific clinical manifestation of IAD."

There have been several technologic advances in diaper design the last several years; however, due to the unique environment of the diaper area, many children continue to suffer from a variety of dermatologic conditions of this region. Common causes include allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, infection, and psoriasis. Treatments include allergen avoidance, barrier protection, parent education, and topical therapies."

3,3,Diaper Dermatitis,,,Anthonella B. Benitez Ojeda,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk559067/,"Diaper dermatitis is an inflammatory reaction of the skin of the perineal and perianal areas (diaper area). It is the most common skin disorder seen in young infants. It is most commonly caused by irritation of the skin; however, there are other causes such as atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis that can present as a diaper rash. Another common reason is infection with Candida albicans, which can be primary or secondary. Diaper dermatitis is usually a mild and self-limited condition that requires minimal intervention. Some of the management approaches include skincare, adequate hygiene, and avoidance of any irritant substance."
4,4,Differential diagnoses of diaper dermatitis,2018,Pediatr Dermatol,Regina FÃ¶lster-Holst,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.13484,"Diaper dermatitis is the most common contact eczema present in early childhood. The main cause is an irritant reaction to urine and feces, which is facilitated by the occlusive conditions under the diaper, leading to hyperhydration of the stratum corneum (diaper dermatitis). In addition, diaper pressure and friction can increase the risk of skin inflammation, which also opens the skin up to other irritant agents, allergens, and infectious agents, such as candida albicans. However, a variety of diseases are associated with inflammation of the skin in the diaper region, therefore the term ""diaper dermatitis"" is merely descriptive and does not reflect anything about the etiopathogenesis. The term diaper dermatitis refers only to an inflammation in the diapering area and should not be automatically equated with reactions to diapers. Making the correct diagnosis requires a thorough examination of the skin in its entirety and a detailed report of the patient's medical and family history. Once a specific pattern is identified, a precise diagnosis, and an appropriate therapy, can be determined."
5,5,Prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis,2018,Pediatr Dermatol,Ulrike Blume-Peytavi,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.13495,"Diaper dermatitis (DD) is one of the most common skin conditions that infants suffer from and their caregivers manage in the first months post-birth. As such, questions of effective prevention and treatment of the condition often arise. Nonmedical skincare practices that support healthy skin barrier function can prevent DD manifestation or alleviate the condition in many cases. The usage of barrier emollients and improved diaper technology contributes to keeping moisture and irritants away from an infant's delicate skin. This paper addresses facts behind commonly asked questions from caregivers regarding DD and discusses effective measures to prevent and treat the condition."
6,6,Incontinence-associated dermatitis and pressure ulcers in geriatric patients,2015,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,J Kottner,,"The key characteristics of geriatric patients are advanced age, multimorbidity, a decrease of psychical performance and care dependency. In addition, advanced age, chronic and acute diseases and treatments (e.g. polypharmacy) lead, either directly or indirectly, to a wide range of skin and tissue problems. Incontinence-associated dermatitis and pressure ulcers (PUs) belong to the most prevalent in geriatric settings. Prolonged exposure of the skin to urine and/or stool can cause an irritant contact dermatitis. Skin surface 'wetness', increased skin surface pH, digestive intestinal enzymes, repeated skin cleansing activities, and a possible occlusive environment contribute to irritation and inflammation. Prevention and treatment includes activities to maintain and to enhance continence and to limit, to reduce exposure of the skin to urine and stool, and to promote healing and reepithelialisation. In frail aged skin, it is recommended to use incontinence products with smooth and breathable materials with maximum absorption capacity. Immediate skin cleansing after soiling using mild cleansers and protective and caring leave-on products are recommended. PUs are localized injuries to the skin and/or underlying tissue caused by sustained deformations of skin and underlying soft tissues. PUs management includes risk assessment, repositioning and mobilization, and the use of appropriate support surfaces. Patients must be never positioned directly on an existing PU. Especially at end of life, the PU closure and wound healing may not be the primary therapeutic goal."
7,7,Effectiveness of topical skin products in the treatment and prevention of incontinence-associated dermatitis: a systematic review,2017,JBI Database System Rev Implement Rep,Priscilla Pather,https://doi.org/10.11124/jbisrir-2016-003015,"Background: Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is inflammation of the skin resulting from repeated contact with urine and/or feces. It causes pain, redness, swelling and excoriation, and may lead to complications such as fungal skin infections and pressure injuries. It is important to prevent and treat IAD to avoid complications and improve patient outcomes. A number of products are available for protecting skin, but evidence on their effectiveness is limited.
Objectives: The current review aimed to establish the effectiveness of topical skin products in reducing the occurrence and/or severity of IAD.
Inclusion criteria types of participants: Adult patients over the age of 18 years with incontinence and/or diarrhea.
Types of intervention: Topical skin products as individual interventions or part of a skin care regimen.
Types of studies: Both published and unpublished study designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, before and after, prospective and retrospective cohort, case-control, analytical cross-sectional, descriptive study designs including case series, individual case reports and descriptive cross-sectional studies across all care settings for inclusion.
Outcomes: The primary outcome of interest was the absence or non-development, reduction or resolution, new development or increase in the occurrence of IAD or the increase in severity of IAD. The secondary outcome was any adverse effect caused by the skin care products used.
Search strategy: A three-step search strategy to find both published and unpublished papers was utilized in this review. Studies were limited to those published in English from 1980 to 2016.
Methodological quality: Papers selected were assessed by two independent reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI).
Data extraction: Data were extracted using the standardized data extraction tool in JBI-MAStARI. The data extracted included specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes.
Data synthesis: Studies were assessed for methodological quality and statistical significance to determine validity and generalizability of study results. It was not possible to pool studies to conduct meta-analysis or test for heterogeneity.
Results: There were a limited number of clinical trials that compared products for efficacy in preventing and treating IAD. Assessment tools and severity scores used to measure skin damage outcomes were dissimilar and prone to subjectivity. It was difficult to ascertain superiority of any individual product.
Conclusion: Information on barrier protective efficacy, side effects and cost can be valuable to both clinicians and care providers. More randomized controlled trials on product effectiveness for prevention and treatment of IAD are highly recommended."
8,8,Prevention of diaper dermatitis in infants--a literature review,2014,Pediatr Dermatol,Ulrike Blume-Peytavi,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.12348,"Diaper dermatitis (DD) is one of the most common skin conditions in neonates and infants, with a peak between the ages of 9 and 12 months. Appropriate skin care practices that support skin barrier function and protect the buttocks skin from urine and feces are supposed to be effective in the prevention of DD. Despite many recommendations for parents and caregivers on proper diaper skin care, there is no up-to-date synthesis of the available evidence to develop recommendations for DD prevention practice. Therefore we performed a systematic literature review on the efficacy of nonmedical skin care practices on the diapered area of healthy, full-term infants ages 0 to 24 months. We identified 13 studies covering skin care practices such as cleansing, bathing, and application of topical products. DD prevalence and incidence and physiologic skin parameters were used as efficacy parameters. The results of this review indicate that cleansing of the diaper area using baby wipes or water and a washcloth have comparable effects on diapered skin. Bathing with a liquid baby cleanser twice weekly seems comparable with water alone. The application of ointments containing zinc oxide or petrolatum with or without vitamin A seems to have comparable effects on DD severity. There seems to be no information on whether single skin care practices such as cleansing, bathing, and application of topical preparations can prevent DD. High-quality randomized clinical trials are needed to show the effectiveness of skin care practices for controlling and preventing DD."
9,9,"A decade of research on Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis (IAD): Evidence, knowledge gaps and next steps",2017,J Tissue Viability,Dimitri Beeckman,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtv.2016.02.004,"Background: Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis (IAD) is one of the clinical manifestations of Moisture- Associated Skin Damage (MASD). IAD is a common problem in aged patients with fecal and/or urinary incontinence.
Aim: Update about IAD terminology, etiology, epidemiology, observation, prevention, and treatment.
Methods: Integrative review.
Results: The lack of an ICD-10 code and an internationally validated and standardized method for IAD data collection contribute to a variation in epidemiological data. Frequent episodes of incontinence (especially fecal), occlusive containment products, poor skin condition, reduced mobility, diminished cognitive awareness, inability to perform personal hygiene, pain, pyrexia, certain medications (antibiotics, immunosuppressants), poor nutritional status, and critical illness are associated with IAD. Correctly diagnosing IAD and distinguish it from pressure ulcers is difficult. Even though the clinical presentation of partial thickness pressure ulcers and IAD is similar, the underlying etiologic factors differ. However, incontinence and IAD were found to be risk factors for pressure ulcer development. IAD management should essentially focus on skin cleansing to remove dirt, debris and microorganisms; skin moisturization to repair or augment the skin's barrier; and the application of a skin barrier product to prevent skin breakdown by providing an impermeable or semi-permeable barrier on the skin. The body of evidence is still limited, but growing since the last decade.
Conclusion: Incontinence causes disruptions of the skin barrier function and leads to superficial skin damage. Macerated skin and superficial skin changes due to incontinence are associated with pressure ulcer development. Skin maceration, chemical irritation, and physical irritation should be targeted to effectively prevent and treat IAD."
10,10,Neonatal skin care: Developments in care to maintain neonatal barrier function and prevention of diaper dermatitis,2019,Pediatr Dermatol,Oliver Burdall,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.13714,"Background: Understanding the importance of the barrier function of the skin of preterm and term neonates is crucial in effective neonatal skin and diaper care. This literature search aimed to review the development of different practices in neonatal care to maintain skin barrier function, in turn preventing diaper dermatitis.
Methods: We performed two quantitative literature searches of English language studies: an initial literature search of studies published in the last 5 years was conducted using Cinahl, Medline, Embase, British Nursing Index, and DelphiS, followed by a second search of publications from 1990 to 2017 using the National Institute of Clinical Excellence Health Databases Advanced Search using key words, synonyms, and Boolean phrasing. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance.
Results: One hundred ten studies were analyzed for the purpose of this review; however, data are of variable quality. Guidance can be drawn from the existing literature relating to best practice options for diaper area cleansing methods, diaper type selection, and use of barrier creams. More research is required into the benefit or otherwise of diaper-free time.
Conclusions: Super-absorbent diapers reduce moisture at skin level and reduce diaper dermatitis. Barrier creams carry benefit both in prevention and cure but do not provide a substitute for frequent diaper changes. The literature does not demonstrate superiority of one cleansing method over another, but neither the use of wipes nor water increases diaper dermatitis prevalence. Further studies are required to explore the potential benefit of diaper-free time, taking due consideration of the practicalities, particularly for vulnerable neonates within the Intensive Care setting."
11,11,Diagnosis and management of diaper dermatitis in infants with emphasis on skin microbiota in the diaper area,2018,Int J Dermatol,Maja Å ikiÄ PogaÄar,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.13748,"Diaper dermatitis is the most common inflammatory skin eruption within the diaper area in infants and toddlers. Although it rarely causes problems for prolonged periods of time, it causes considerable distress for both infants and parents. Diapered skin is exposed to friction, excessive hydration, varying pH, and is in constant contact with urine and feces, both of which are highly irritant to the skin. The three most common types of diaper dermatitis include chaffing dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and diaper candidiasis. However, a variety of other skin conditions may manifest in the diaper area. Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated from the affected area and are thought to have a predominant role in diaper dermatitis. The review includes an overview of the epidemiology, etiology, and common skin microbiota in the diaper area. State-of-the-art strategies for diagnosis, management, and prevention of diaper dermatitis are also included. Appropriate skin care can help in the prevention of diaper dermatitis and can aid the reparation of the skin. This review discusses common causes, skin microbiota within the diapered area, differential diagnosis, and finally possible prevention and treatment recommendations. Recent findings have proven that the key to efficient eradication of irritant diaper dermatitis lies in its prevention."
12,12,[Development of a Breathable Protective Ointment for Moisture-associated Skin Damage],2019,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yasunori Miyazaki,https://doi.org/10.1248/yakushi.19-00121-3,"In this symposium, we present a novel breathable protective ointment (BPO) formulation developed at the University of Shizuoka for the prevention of moisture-associated skin damage (MASD) intended for use in healthcare settings. MASD occurs when moisture is in constant contact with the skin for prolonged periods of time, causing degradation of the skin barrier. Exposure to physical or chemical stimuli in addition to moisture may lead to different types of moisture-associated dermatitis such as incontinence-associated or periwound dermatitis. Another type of moisture-associated dermatitis, diaper dermatitis, is treated with protective ointments such as white petrolatum and zinc ointment. These ointments protect the skin from irritants but also block insensible dermal perspiration, which promotes further skin maceration. Therefore, we have developed a BPO formulation from white petrolatum and calcium carbonate, which serve as a protectant and pore-forming agent, respectively. In vitro water-proof tests confirmed the skin-protective properties of the BPO, and moisture-permeation tests indicated its breathability. Moreover, the BPO protected the skin from irritants without the loss of skin hydration in rats. Our next step involves the trial of BPO in infants with diaper dermatitis. In the future, this BPO could be used as an ointment base for active pharmaceutical ingredients used to prevent MASD."
13,13,Examining Prevalence and Risk Factors of Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis Using the International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey,2019,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Susan A Kayser,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000548,"Purpose: To evaluate prevalence and risk factors of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD).
Design: Retrospective analysis of 2016 International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence survey data.
Subjects and setting: Adult patients who were in acute care, long-term acute care, long-term care, and rehabilitation facilities in the United States and Canada.
Methods: IAD prevalence was calculated among all patients surveyed, among the incontinent patients only, across multiple care settings, and by incontinence type. A logistic regression examined risk factors for IAD in the incontinent population.
Results: Nearly 1 in 5 incontinent patients had IAD documented. Incontinence-associated dermatitis prevalence in the entire patient population was 4.3% while incontinence prevalence was 18%. Of incontinent patients, prevalence of IAD ranged from 8.4% in long-term care facilities to 19% in acute care facilities. Facilities with higher rates of incontinence did not necessarily have higher prevalence of IAD. Incontinence-associated dermatitis prevalence by incontinence type ranged from 12% for patients with urinary incontinence to 26% for patients with fecal management systems. Regression results support the association of the following factors with an increased likelihood of IAD documented: all types of incontinence, fecal management systems, higher body weight, diminished mobility, additional linen layers, longer length of stay, and lower Braden Scale scores.
Conclusions: Incontinence-associated dermatitis remains a concern in acute care settings. Risk factors associated with IAD were similar to risk factors previously reported for hospital-acquired pressure injuries, such as limited mobility, longer lengths of stay, and additional linen layers. By consistently documenting IAD as well as pressure injury prevalence, facilities may benchmark overall skin prevention models."
14,14,[Decubitus or incontinence-associated dermatitis?],2014,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Ronald H Houwing,,"A lack of understanding about the distinction between incontinence-associated dermatitis and pressure sores leads to inadequate treatment and therefore a higher incidence of pressure sores. Pressure relief may not be adequately carried out due to concentration exclusively on treatment of incontinence. In this article we will discuss the multifactorial approach, based on 2 patient cases. In order to prevent pressure sores, the cause of incontinence has to be investigated and treated if possible. Appropriate pressure relief must be carried out, in addition to adequate skin care."
15,15,Do Intra-anal Bowel Management Devices Reduce Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis and/or Pressure Injuries?,2017,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Terrie Beeson,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000381,"Purpose: The purpose of this article was to examine the evidence and provide recommendations related to the effectiveness of intra-anal bowel management systems including intra-anal bowel catheters and rectal trumpets in reducing incontinence-associated dermatitis and pressure injuries.
Question: Does the use of an intra-anal bowel management system (intra-anal bowel catheter or rectal trumpet) reduce incontinence-associated skin damage and/or hospital-acquired pressure injuries in the acute care adult patient population?
Search strategy: A search of the literature was performed by a trained university librarian, which resulted in 133 articles that examined intra-anal bowel management systems (intra-anal bowel catheter and rectal trumpet), incontinence-associated dermatitis, and pressure injuries. A systematic approach was used to review titles, abstracts, and text yielding 6 studies that met inclusion criteria. Strength of the evidence was rated using rating methodology from Essential Evidence Plus: Levels of evidence and Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine, adapted by Gray and colleagues.
Findings: Five of the 6 studies reported positive results concerning the effectiveness of intra-anal bowel management systems to reduce incontinence-associated dermatitis and/or pressure injuries. One randomized control trial found no improvement in incontinence-associated dermatitis in the intra-anal bowel management system (intra-anal bowel catheter or rectal trumpet) groups or pressure injuries as compared to usual care. The strength of the evidence for the identified studies was moderate (2 level A, 3 level B, and 1 level C). An important finding in 2 of the studies was the safety of the intra-anal bowel management systems-both intra-anal bowel catheter and rectal trumpet.
Conclusion/recommendation: Evidence indicates intra-anal bowel management system (intra-anal bowel catheters and rectal trumpet) provides a viable option for fecal incontinence management and these devices reduce incontinence-associated dermatitis and/or pressure injuries."
16,16,Common Skin Conditions in Children: Neonatal Skin Lesions,2017,FP Essent,Brian Z Rayala,,"Skin findings during the initial month of life are ubiquitous. One study estimated that more than 95% of newborns have cutaneous findings, which often are distressing to parents but frequently are benign and self-limited. Among them are milia, cutis marmorata, congenital dermal melanocytosis, and the benign neonatal pustular eruptions (eg, benign cephalic pustulosis, erythema toxicum neonatorum, transient neonatal pustular melanosis). Clinicians need to recognize these benign skin conditions and differentiate them from more serious conditions, such as infectious pustular eruptions from bacterial, viral, and fungal causes, and inflammatory conditions, such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Notable bacterial pustular eruptions are bullous impetigo and congenital syphilis. Viral pustular dermatoses include neonatal herpes simplex virus infection and varicella zoster virus infection, which consists of congenital varicella syndrome, perinatal varicella, and infantile zoster. Fungal pustular eruptions include congenital and neonatal candidiasis. Seborrheic dermatitis is a self-limited condition that occurs with varying severity; symptomatic treatment is reserved for the more severe forms. Diaper dermatitis encompasses a broad clinical diagnosis, including allergic and irritant contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, infections, psoriasis, and other dermatologic conditions. Critical components of newborn skin care are immersion bathing, umbilical cord care, and use of emollients to augment skin barrier function."

Objective: The objective of this article was to determine the effect of zinc supplementation on inflammatory dermatologic conditions.
Data sources: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Ovid with no time limit up to 29 May, 2019. Trials examining supplementation with zinc in the treatment of inflammatory dermatological conditions (acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, diaper dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, and rosacea) in children and adults were selected.
Results: Of 229 articles, 22 met inclusion criteria. Supplementation with zinc was found to be beneficial in ten of 14 studies evaluating its effects on acne vulgaris, one of two studies on atopic dermatitis, one of one study on diaper dermatitis, and three of three studies evaluating its effects on hidradenitis suppurativa. However, the one article found on psoriasis and the one article found on rosacea showed no significant benefit of zinc treatment on disease outcome.
Conclusions and implications: Some preliminary evidence supports the use of zinc in the treatment of acne vulgaris and hidradenitis suppurativa; however, more research is needed with similar methodologies and larger sample sizes in these diseases. Further, zinc may be of some benefit in the treatment plan for atopic dermatitis and diaper dermatitis; however, additional studies should be conducted to further evaluate these potentially positive associations. To date, no evidence is available to suggest that zinc may be of benefit in rosacea and psoriasis; however, limited data are available evaluating the use of zinc in these conditions."
18,18,[Incontinence-associated dermatitis: a position paper],2020,Hautarzt,J Kottner,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00105-019-04480-7,"Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) describes damage to the skin caused by repeated and prolonged contact with urine and/or feces. Patients of all ages can be affected; the diagnosis is preferably used in adults and adolescents. The predilection sites are perineal, perianal, the inner thighs and the convex areas of the buttocks. Increased moisture on the skin surface, increased pH, occlusion, feces digestive enzymes and repeated skin cleansing procedures are pathophysiologically relevant factors. Typical clinical signs of IAD are erythema, erosions, excoriations and pain. Diagnosis is often difficult because there are many relevant differential diagnoses, some of which may occur together with an IAD. In particular, pressure ulcer, contact dermatitis and intertrigo need to be differentiated and treated. Effective strategies of prevention and therapy of IAD are continence management, the use of efficient, absorbent products as well as consistent skin protection and care. IAD is a skin disease that is often not or incorrectly diagnosed. It should be treated as early as possible, together with the causative factors such a fecal and/or urinary incontinence, as otherwise it can lead to an unnecessarily long duration and severity of the symptoms."

For the therapy nurses and parents have the choice between numerous barrier creams based on zinc oxide, Dexpanthenol or Vaseline in various combinations of active agents and with additional ingredients. Research question: Which combination of active ingredients in local barrier creams reduce pain, severity of or duration of healing in IAD in neonates, infants and young children? Method: MEDLINE and CINAHL was systematically search for randomized controlled trials on the effect of barrier creams in pediatric patients with IAD. These were evaluated on validity and applicability. Results: 15 RCTs were found, of which six were included in the systematic review. The methodological quality of these trials ranges from good to poor, partially high bias risk were recognizable. Barrier creams containing the active ingredients zinc oxide / lanolin, zinc oxide / cod liver oil, zinc oxide / Dexpanthenol, paraffin / beeswax / Dexpanthenol show effects. They reduce the IAD-associated symptoms. Conclusions: The investigated barrier creams can be used in the pediatric nursing for the treatment of IAD. Because of limitations it cannot be ruled out that further studies will change the results."

We measured the following outcomes: (1) skin physiological characteristics indicating skin protection and enhancement of the skin's moisture barrier (stratum corneum hydration, dermis hydration level, transepidermal water loss, and skin pH); and (2) changes in skin appearance (the degree of erythema and pigmentation, and the sulcus cutis condition).
Design: Single-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial.
Subjects and setting: The study was conducted in a long-term care facility in Japan between November 7, 2011, and May 6, 2012. We used block randomization to obtain a random sample of 6 (4 experimental and 2 control) out of 10 available wards. All subjects were elderly women with IAD of the buttock or inner thigh. We assessed 295 patients, but only 33 met inclusion criteria; 18 were allocated to the experimental group and 15 were allocated to the control group.
Methods: All participants were managed with cleansing with a skin cleanser and application of a moisturizer daily. In addition, a skin barrier cream designed to enhance the skin's moisture barrier and act as a protective barrier was applied to the skin of patients in the experimental group 3 times a day when absorptive briefs were changed. Skin physiological and appearance characteristics were scored only at the buttock or thigh area. All data were collected on days 1 and 14 of the study.
Results: Univariate analysis found that the erythema index was lower in the intervention group than in the control group at day 14 (P = .004). Multivariate analysis found significant associations between use of the skin barrier cream and increased stratum corneum hydration (Î²= .443, P = .031), decreased skin pH (Î²=-.439, P = .020), and magnitude of erythema (Î²=-.451, P = .018).
Conclusions: Study findings suggest that a barrier cream designed to enhance the skin's moisture barrier and act as a skin protectant increased stratum corneum hydration, reduced cutaneous pH, and reduced erythema."

However, diaper dermatitis still occurs, especially in children in daycare settings. This study attempted to determine the prevalence of diaper dermatitis and its associated factors among children aged 2 to 4 years attending daycare centers. Cross-sectional analysis and tests for correlation were conducted to determine the factors associated with diaper dermatitis among the study population. Results: The prevalence of diaper dermatitis during the study period was 17.2%. Factors significantly correlated with the occurrence of diaper dermatitis were beginning toilet training later than 2 years of age (odds ratio [OR] = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.17-6.86, P = .02) and the use of oral antibiotics (OR = 15.92, 95%CI = 3.57-70.94, P < .001). Conclusion: Two major adjustable factors for preventing diaper dermatitis in the study population were toilet training before 2 years of age and avoiding the use of unnecessary oral antibiotics. These results may help in devising a preventive protocol for diaper dermatitis among this age group in the future."

Our survey showed that the nurses in our unit scored an average of 78.9% on knowledge related to the prevention of incontinence-associated dermatitis and only 58.2% on knowledge related to incontinence-associated dermatitis care. The main reasons for the high incidence of incontinence-associated dermatitis included: incorrect implementation of care, no discussion with the medical team, no incontinence care standards, no continue education, lack of related equipment for preventing incontinence-associated dermatitis, unit patient characteristics, and drugs used.
Purpose: To reduce the incidence of incontinence-associated dermatitis from 40.3% to 32.0%.
Resolution: A care-bundle in treating incontinence-associated dermatitis was implemented by designing an assessment flow chart for evaluating incontinence-associated dermatitis, by setting standard guidelines for incontinence-associated dermatitis care, by distributing reminder cards, special toolboxes, and by changing how the little diapers were wrapped. In-service education lessons, inter-professional collaborative practice, and regular internal audit were also executed.
Results: After project implementation, the knowledge score of nurses increased from 78.9% to 95.7%; the correctness of care score, as retested in November 2017, increased from 58.2% to 91.5%; and the incidence of incontinence-associated dermatitis dropped to 18.5%. These improvements achieved the goals of this project. Furthermore, the sustained effect of the project measures was confirmed, with the incidence of incontinence-associated dermatitis determined as 17.9% at three months after completion of the project.
Conclusions: Formulating care procedures and cooperating with medical team personnel to provide creative care measures were shown to effectively decrease the incidence of incontinence-associated dermatitis and improve overall quality of care. The findings of this project support the revision by hospitals of regulations and procedures related to adult incontinence-associated dermatitis to provide caregivers with basis-of-care standards and uniform care procedures and standards in support of effective patient skin care regimens."
25,25,Incontinence-associated dermatitis in the critically ill patient: an intensive care perspective,2018,Nurs Crit Care,Fiona Coyer,https://doi.org/10.1111/nicc.12331,"Background: Incontinence-associated dermatitis is a skin disorder evident as a complication of incontinence. It is characterized by perineal, buttock and groin erythema and skin breakdown. Incontinence-associated dermatitis is a ubiquitous, nosocomial condition commonly present in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Critically ill patients, by the nature of their critical illness and therapies used to treat their presenting condition, are commonly predisposed to faecal incontinence and are consequently at high risk of developing incontinence-associated dermatitis. However, this condition is under-explored and under-reported in the intensive care literature.
Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide a review of the literature relating to incontinence-associated dermatitis from the critically ill patients in the intensive care setting.
Discussion: There is a paucity of literature addressing this condition in the intensive care context, with only 11 studies identified. This paper will provide an overview of the definitions, prevalence and incidence of incontinence-associated dermatitis. Furthermore, an exposition of incontinence-associated dermatitis from the critically ill patient and intensive care nursing perspectives will be presented through a review of the skin barrier function, clinical presentation, risk factors, clinical assessment and severity categorization, prevention and management of incontinence-associated dermatitis.
Conclusion: It is imperative that critical care nurses have an appreciation of incontinence-associated dermatitis as a common, yet preventable condition, and are equipped with knowledge to appropriately prevent and manage this common complication."
26,26,Core outcome domains in incontinence-associated dermatitis research,2018,J Adv Nurs,Karen Van den Bussche,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.13562,"Aim: To report the development of a core set of outcome domains for clinical research involving adults with incontinence-associated dermatitis or at risk, independently from any geographical location or skin colour.
Background: The management of incontinence-associated dermatitis is important in caring for incontinent patients. The lack of comparability of clinical trial outcomes is a major challenge in the field of evidence-based incontinence-associated dermatitis prevention and treatment. Core outcome sets may therefore be helpful to improve the value of clinical incontinence-associated dermatitis research.
Design: Systematic literature review, patient interviews and consensus study using Delphi procedure.
Methods: A list of outcome domains was generated through a systematic literature review (no date restrictions-April 2016), consultation of an international steering committee and three patient interviews. The project team reviewed and refined the outcome domains prior to starting a three-round Delphi procedure conducted between April-September 2017. The panellists, including healthcare providers, researchers and industry were invited to rate the importance of the outcome domains.
Results: We extracted 1,852 outcomes from 244 articles. Experts proposed 56 and patients 32 outcome domains. After refinement, 57 panellists from 17 countries rated a list of 58 outcome domains. The final list of outcome domains includes erythema, erosion, maceration, IAD-related pain and patient satisfaction.
Conclusion: Erythema, erosion, maceration, incontinence-associated dermatitis -related pain and patient satisfaction are the most important outcome domains to be measured in incontinence-associated dermatitis trials. Based on this international consensus on what to measure, the question of how to measure these domains now requires consideration. Registration: This project has been registered in the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET Initiative) database and is part of the Cochrane Skin Group-Core Outcomes Set Initiative (CSG-COUSIN)."

Little research has focused on IAD, resulting in significant gaps in our understanding of its epidemiology, natural history, etiology, and pathophysiology. A growing number of studies have examined clinical and economic outcomes associated with prevention strategies, but less research exists concerning the efficacy of various treatments. In the clinical and research settings, IAD is often combined with skin damage caused by pressure and shear or related factors, sometimes leading to confusion among clinicians concerning its etiology and diagnosis. This article reviews existing literature related to IAD, outlines strategies for assessing, preventing, and treating IAD, and provides suggestions for additional research needed to enhance our understanding and management of this common but under-reported and understudied skin disorder."
28,28,PROTECT - Trial: A cluster RCT to study the effectiveness of a repositioning aid and tailored repositioning to increase repositioning compliance,2019,J Adv Nurs,Dorien De Meyer,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.13932,"Aim: To study the effectiveness of tailored repositioning and a turning and repositioning system on: (a) nurses' compliance to repositioning frequencies; (b) body posture of patients after repositioning; (c) incidence of pressure ulcers and incontinence-associated dermatitis; (d) nurses' and patients' preferences, comfort and acceptability; and (e) budget impact.
Background: Patient-tailored systematic repositioning is key in pressure ulcer prevention. To date, a clinical decision-making tool is lacking and compliance to pressure ulcer prevention guidelines is low. Research concerning commercially available turning and repositioning systems is lacking.
Design: Multicentre, cluster, three-arm, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial.
Methods: Two hundred and twenty-seven patients at risk of pressure ulcer development were recruited at 29 wards in 16 hospitals between February 2016 and December 2017. Wards were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and one control group.
Results: Nurses' compliance to repositioning frequencies increased significantly in the experimental groups when patients were cared for in bed (94.6% vs. 69% and 84.9% vs. 71.4%). Applying the turning and repositioning system was associated with significantly more correctly positioned patients (30-45Â° tilted side-lying position) (69.6% vs. 34.6%). Few pressure ulcers and incontinence-associated dermatitis incidents occurred. Both patients and nurses were positive about the intervention. Higher labour costs related to repositioning in bed were found in the control group.
Conclusion: This was the first study investigating the effect of tailored repositioning and the use of a repositioning aid to increase nurses' compliance to repositioning. The results were in favour of the interventions yet demonstrating the importance of follow-up and education.
Trial registration: This study is registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02690753;NCT02690753."
29,29,Comparative Study between Talcum and Zinc Oxide Cream for the Prevention of Irritant Contact Diaper Dermatitis in Infants,2016,J Med Assoc Thai,Suthida Chaithirayanon,,"Background: Baby powder which consists of talcum powder (magnesium silicate) as an active ingredient has been popularly used for prevention of irritant contact diaper dermatitis for a long time because it has water absorbent and friction-decreased properties. There are some case reports of its side effects of pulmonary complication from massive inhalation and the risk of ovarian tumors in adult. However the clinical research on the effectiveness of talcum powder for the prevention of diaper dermatitis has not been investigated.
Objective: To compare the effectiveness between talcum powder with topical zinc oxide cream for the prevention of irritant diaper dermatitis.
Materials and method: Fifty Thai infants at the age of 6-12 months old were randomized. Either topical talcum powder or zinc oxide cream was topically applied to their skin before changing new diapers. The follow-up were conducted at week 0, 2 and 8 to evaluate an occurrence of diaper dermatitis and to collect the median time-to-event data (the duration of disease occurrence). The clinical severity was assessed by using diaper dermatitis severity scoring scale and the side effects were recorded.
Results: The average age of the infants was 8.8 months old. The incidence of irritant contact diaper dermatitis from the talcum group was 4 per 1,000 persons-day (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 2-7) while the incidence of diaper dermatitis from the zinc oxide group was 2 per 1,000 persons-day (95% CI: 1-5). The median time-to-event outcome of diaper dermatitis for the talcum group was 19 days (interquartile range, IQR: 7-29) which was earlier than that of zinc oxide group, which was 39 days (IQR: 30-59). This showed statistically significant difference (p = 0.03, Log rank test). The average of disease duration of the talcum group (mean + SD) was 2.7+0.5 days whereas that of the zinc oxide group was 3.7+3.3 days. There is no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.34). Most of the severity of the disease found in both groups is mild. The risk evaluation of diaper dermatitis at week 8, determined by using Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the talcum group had 5.3 times greater risk than the zinc oxide group (hazard ratio, HR; 5.3, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.4-20.0), with significant group difference (p = 0.01). There was no adverse effect detected on both groups.
Conclusion: Topical zinc oxide cream was better than talcum powder for the prevention of irritant contact diaper dermatitis."

Methods: From 2012 to 2014, 3 consecutive annual cross-sectional multicenter studies in 5785 residents in 78 German nursing homes were conducted. Secondary data analysis was performed including all incontinent residents with complete data from the German version of the IADIT-D and validated instrument to assess IAD. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent variables associated with IAD occurrence.
Results: The overall prevalence of any type of incontinence was 68.3%. Of the total sample, 58.8% (n = 3406) were eligible for the study. Estimated point prevalence of IAD was 5.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5%-6.0%). According to the IADIT-D, the prevalence of patients with high risk for IAD was 25.3%; early IAD, 2.1%; moderate, 2.0%; severe, 0.2%; and fungal-appearing rash, 1.0%. Body mass index (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09), fall risk (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97), pressure injury (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.24-4.04), and female gender (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.94) were statistically significantly associated with IAD in residents with urinary and/or fecal incontinence.
Conclusions: IAD is prevalent in nursing home residents. Knowledge about potential risk factors, for example higher body mass index, should be enhanced and integrated into planning of nursing interventions especially skin protection measures."

It is a type of irritant contact eczema resulting from a complex interaction between urine and feces under occlusive conditions in combination with the hyperhydration of the stratum corneum, pressure and friction under the diaper. These conditions pave the way for Candida albicans infection, which is often associated with diaper dermatitis. The anogenital region can be involved by a variety of dermatoses, so a precise skin examination, detailed history and sometimes histologic examination are needed for a precise diagnosis. Therapeutically, frequent diaper changes and adequate skin care are most important."

Method: Cross-sectional exploratory study carried out in public hospitals. The dermatitis prevalence and associations were obtained by calculating the ratio. The effect dimension was estimated by the odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval and statistical significance p <0.05.
Results: 138 elderly people were included, with an average age of 77.2 years old (Â± 9.3); 69 (50%) had combined fecal and urinary incontinence. The dermatitis prevalence was 36.2% (50); 28% (14) had pressure injuries; 14% (7), candidiasis. Risk factors were: longer hospital stay (Odds Ratio = 5.8 [2.6-12.9]), obesity (Odds Ratio = 3.6 [1.2-10.4]), high level of dependence (Odds Ratio = 2.4 [1,1-5,0]) and high risk for pressure injury (Odds Ratio = 6.1 [1,4-26,9]).

33,33,Outcome measurement instruments for erythema associated with incontinence-associated dermatitis: Systematic review,2019,J Adv Nurs,Dorien De Meyer,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14102,"Aim: To: (a) examine which outcome measurement instruments for erythema associated with incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) with supporting evidence about measurement properties are available; (b) evaluate the methodological quality of the studies and the quality of the measurement properties; and (c) identify eligible instruments to measure erythema in incontinence-associated dermatitis research.
Design: Systematic review.
Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL were systematically searched until July 2018 (update December 2018). Additional input was gathered from 151 incontinence-associated dermatitis experts. Cited and citing references of included studies were screened.
Review methods: The COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist was applied to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies. Reported measurement properties were rated against criteria for good measurement properties.
Results: Fourteen studies, describing 10 measurement instruments, were included. In five instruments, erythema was captured as a separate concept, two studies provided empirical evidence about the measurement properties. The most studied measurement properties were reliability (9 studies), measurement error (4 studies) and criterion validity (4 studies). In one study, internal consistency was examined.
Conclusion: No instrument measuring exclusively erythema associated with incontinence-associated dermatitis exists. There is no single composite incontinence-associated dermatitis measurement instrument that outperforms others. Development or adaption of an instrument to measure erythema associated with incontinence-associated dermatitis is one option to solve this challenge.
Impact: The evidence about measurement properties of instruments measuring erythema associated with incontinence-associated dermatitis has not been summarized to date. The lack of an instrument should trigger activities to measure this domain accurately in future clinical trials."

Study design: We searched MEDLINE for studies conducted between January 1, 1966, and August 25, 2018. Two authors independently assessed potential studies and extracted the data. We included published randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, and cohort studies that evaluated the incidence of diarrhea, generalized rash, diaper rash, and candidal diaper dermatitis associated with the use of amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, azithromycin, cefdinir, and placebo in children with acute otitis media.
Results: We included 82 studies in the meta-analysis. The incidence of diarrhea, listed from lowest to highest, was azithromycin (2.2%), placebo (6.9%), low-dose amoxicillin (8.7%), cefdinir (13.0%), high-dose amoxicillin (13.8%), and high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (18.9%). The incidence of generalized rash, listed from lowest to highest, was azithromycin (1.4%), placebo (2.3%), low-dose amoxicillin (2.9%), high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4.9%), and high-dose amoxicillin (6.5%). In studies of low-dose amoxicillin, we found a higher incidence of diarrhea in studies that used daily diaries to collect information about diarrhea and a lower incidence of generalized rash in studies that reported only rashes judged to be secondary to antibiotic use.
Conclusions: The incidence of AEs varies widely depending on which antibiotic is used and how the information on AEs was collected or reported. The AEs rates reported here may be helpful to clinicians when choosing an antibiotic to treat acute otitis media."

Background: Incontinence-associated dermatitis is a common problem in patients with incontinence. It is a daily challenge for healthcare professionals to maintain a healthy skin in patients with incontinence.
Data sources: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, reference lists and conference proceedings were explored up to September 2008.
Review methods: Publications were included if they reported research on the prevention and treatment of incontinence-associated dermatitis. As little consensus about terminology was found, a very sensitive filter was developed. Study design was not used as a selection criterion due to the explorative character of the review and the scarce literature.
Results: Thirty-six publications, dealing with 25 different studies, were included. The implementation of a structured perineal skin care programme including skin cleansing and the use of a moisturizer is suggested. A skin protectant is recommended for patients considered at risk of incontinence-associated dermatitis development. Perineal skin cleansers are preferable to using water and soap. Skin care is suggested after each incontinence episode, particularly if faeces are present. The quality of methods in the included studies was low.
Conclusions: Incontinence-associated dermatitis can be prevented and healed with timely and appropriate skin cleansing and skin protection. Prevention and treatment should also focus on a proper use of incontinence containment materials. Further research is required to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of various interventions."

Design: Descriptive and comparative secondary data analysis.
Subjects and setting: One hundred eighty-nine community-dwelling individuals with fecal incontinence who participated in a study comparing the effects of dietary fiber on fecal incontinence.
Methods: A survey on the use of absorbent products that contained questions about subjects' history of skin damage was administered at the start of the study.
Results: Incontinence-associated dermatitis occurred in 52.5% of the community-living individuals with fecal incontinence. The severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis was mostly mild to moderate and occurred periodically. Redness without broken skin was the most common manifestation (68%). Most individuals (95%) reported the location of skin damage to be the anal/rectal area. Those with double incontinence also reported dermatitis around the vagina or penis. Individuals with a greater severity of fecal incontinence had a greater severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (r = 0.27, P = .000). Both the frequency of incontinence (r = 0.23, P < .002) and the amount of feces leaked (r = 0.23, P < .002) had a significant correlation with incontinence-associated dermatitis severity. There were no significant differences in the occurrence or severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis by sex, age, or presence of double incontinence.
Conclusion: A high percentage of individuals in the community with fecal incontinence suffer from incontinence-associated dermatitis at times. This population may benefit from consultation with a WOC nurse about prevention and management of incontinence-associated dermatitis."

Methods: This prospective descriptive study aimed to explore variation in cutaneous disease in the diaper area. It was conducted as a prospective descriptive study between October 2016 and November 2019 in the pediatric department of a tertiary-level hospital.
Results: Three hundred consecutive patients with rashes in the diaper area were enrolled. The most common diagnosed was IDD (125 cases; 41.7%), followed by rashes exacerbated by the diaper (101 cases; 33.67%) and non-diaper-related rashes (74 cases; 24.67%).
Conclusions: Our finding suggests that when diagnosing rashes that occur in the diaper area, general pediatricians should consider, in addition to IDD, the possibility of less-common conditions. The simultaneous presence of cutaneous lesions at other sites was linked to diagnoses of systemic diseases other than IDD, (P < 0.001)."

In premature infants, seemingly benign mucocutaneous involvement may precede systemic infection and thus warrants thoughtful attention. Skin involvement also may be seen as an expression of systemic disease. The physical appearance of these lesions is often characteristic, allowing easy diagnosis. The patients at risk differ by gestational age and postnatal age at presentation. Systemic candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis typically occur in premature infants, particularly those with extremely low birth weight (< or = 1,000 g), whereas thrush and diaper dermatitis may occur in infants of any gestational age or birth weight. Congenital candidiasis presents at birth, while invasive fungal dermatitis typically occurs within the first 2 weeks of life, and thrush, diaper dermatitis, and systemic candidiasis may occur at any time in infancy. Controversy exists concerning optimal therapy of mucocutaneous candidiasis."

Elderly adults, and especially those in long-term care facilities, are at risk for urinary or fecal incontinence and IAD. Traditionally, IAD has received little attention as a distinct disorder, and it is sometimes confused with stage I or II pressure ulcers. However, a modest but growing body of research is beginning to provide insights into the epidemiology, etiology, and pathophysiology of IAD. In addition, recent changes in reimbursement policies from the US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding pressure ulcer prevention has focused attention on the differential diagnosis of IAD versus pressure ulcer, and its influence on pressure ulcer risk. Color, location, depth, and the presence or absence of necrotic tissue are visual indicators used to differentiate IAD from pressure-related skin damage. Prevention is based on avoiding or minimizing exposure to stool or urine combined with a structured skin-care program based on principles of gentle cleansing, moisturization, preferably with an emollient, and application of a skin protectant. Treatment of IAD focuses on three main goals: (i) removal of irritants from the affected skin; (ii) eradication of cutaneous infections such as candidiasis; and (iii) containment or diversion of incontinent urine or stool."

A focused history and physical assessment are essential for diagnosing IAD or ITD and distinguishing these forms of skin damage from other types of skin damage. Panel members recommend cleansing, moisturizing, and applying a skin protectant to skin affected by IAD and to the perineal skin of persons with urinary or fecal incontinence deemed at risk for IAD. Prevention and treatment of ITD includes measures to ensure that skin folds are dry and free from friction; however, panel members do not recommend use of bed linens, paper towels, or dressings for separating skin folds. Individuals with ITD are at risk for fungal and bacterial infections and these infections should be treated appropriately; for example, candidal infections should be treated with antifungal therapies."

IAD is caused by urine remaining on the skin following UI, which has many causes. It therefore should be assessed, treated and either resolved or managed to reduce the risk of IAD or its impact. The skin's anatomy and physiology are discussed and the changes resulting from IAD are explained. Should it occur, IAD can be treated by cleansing, moisturising and protecting the skin as appropriate, thus restoring its previous barrier functions. There can be confusion with grade 1 and 2 pressure ulcers, and the article points out the visual differences between these and IAD."

Frequent diaper changes with the superabsorbent disposable diapers may be the best tactic for infants' skin, if not the environment. Also, the more time that infants spend without diapers, the less dermatitis they experience, but a practical balance must be struck. Gentle cleansing and barrier creams are beneficial, and candidal infection must be treated. Finally, any recalcitrant diaper dermatitis must be further investigated to uncover underlying disease (Fig. 6)."

Fungi can take advantage of all these factors. Candida yeasts, especially C. albicans, are responsible for the most frequent secondary infections and are isolated in more than 80 % of cases. Correct diagnosis is important for ensuring the correct prescription of topical antimycotics. Nystatin, imidazoles and ciclopirox are effective. It is important to realize there are resistant strains. Dermatophytes can infect the diaper area, with the most common agent being Epidermophyton floccosum. The clinical characteristics of dermatophytosis are different from those of candidiasis, and it can be diagnosed and treated simply. Malassezia yeasts can aggravate conditions affecting the diaper area, such as seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and inverse psoriasis. Additional treatment is recommended in this case, because they usually involve complement activation and increased specific IgE levels. Erythrasma is a pseudomycosis that is indistinguishable from candidiasis and may also occur in large skin folds. It is treated with topical antibacterial products and some antimycotics."

Urine alters the normal skin flora and increases permeability of the stratum corneum and faecal enzymes on the skin contribute to skin damage. Faecal bacteria can then penetrate the skin, increasing the risk of secondary infection. However, IAD can be prevented and healed with timely and appropriate skin cleansing and skin protection. This includes appropriate use of containment devices. This article also looks at HARTMANN incontinence pads that have been developed to absorb the fluids that cause IAD and maintain the skin's acidic pH. The acidic pH of the skin contributes to its barrier function and defence against infection. Therefore, maintaining an acidic pH will help protect the skin from damage."

Six electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and EconLit. The search string combined index terms and text words related to IAD and monetary data. The quality of the articles was assessed using the consensus on Health Economic Criteria. Results were synthesised narratively because of methodological heterogeneity. Nine studies were included. Only direct medical costs were reported. The product cost per application for prevention ranged between $0.05 and $0.52, and for treatment between $0.20 and $0.35. The product cost per patient/day for prevention ranged between $0.23 and $20.17. The product cost of IAD prevention and treatment per patient/day ranged between $0.57 and $1.08. The cost to treat IAD did not consider the treatment of secondary infection. The calculation of labour cost and total cost differed considerably between studies. Summarising monetary data is a challenge because of heterogeneity in currencies, settings, samples, time horizons, health- and cost outcome valuation, IAD definition and measurements, and included costs. Procedures for health economic evaluations are to be clarified to guarantee valid interpretation and comparison with other studies."

IAD is an inflammatory skin condition secondary to prolonged urine exposure-it is a dermatologic sequela of urinary incontinence. Incontinence should not be dismissed simply as an age-related disorder; rather, it is due to a number of pathologic conditions that can be either reversible or manageable. It is thus critical to identify and treat the underlying causes of urinary incontinence. Clinical management of this common medical issue restores normality to patients' lives while also preventing future dermatologic complications. In this article, we aim to provide dermatologists with an overview of IAD and an approach to the diagnosis and initial management of urinary incontinence."

It is one of the most common dermatologic diseases in infants and children. In the past, the disease was thought to be caused by ammonia; however, a number of factors, such as friction, wetness, inappropriate skin care, microorganisms, antibiotics, and nutritional defects, are important. Diaper dermatitis commonly affects the lower parts of the abdomen, thighs, and diaper area. Involvement of skin fold regions is typical with diaper dermatitis. At the early stages of the disease, only dryness is observed in the affected area. At later stages, erythematous maceration and edema can be seen. Secondary candidal and bacterial infections can complicate the dermatitis. In the differential diagnosis of the disease, allergic contact dermatitis, intertrigo, psoriasis, atopic and seborrheic dermatitis, and the other diseases should be considered. Causes of the disease should be determined and eliminated primarily. Families need to be informed about the importance of a clean, dry diaper area and the frequency of diaper changes. The use of superabsorbent disposable diapers has decreased the incidence of the disease. Soap and alcohol-containing products should be avoided in cleaning the area. In some cases, corticosteroids and antifungal agents can be administered. If necessary, antibacterial agents and calcineurin inhibitors can also be beneficial."

Methods: This open-label pilot randomized controlled feasibility study was conducted in the adult ICU of an Australian quaternary referral hospital. Patients were allocated to either an intervention group or a control group (usual care). The intervention was the application of a skin protectant (a durable, ultra-thin, transparent, waterproof, no-removal barrier film). Data collected by trained research nurses included demographic and clinical variables, skin assessment, and incontinence-associated dermatitis presence and severity. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
Results: Of the 799 patients screened, 85% were eliminated because of a short ICU stay or other exclusion criteria. The mean proportion of patients not meeting any of the exclusion criteria was 22% on each screening day. Protocol fidelity was followed for 90% of intervention participant study days. Retention of participants was 86% (31 participants out of 36), 15 in the intervention group and 16 in the control group. Enrolled patients had a mean age of 59 years, 50% were obese, 67% were male, and 36% were smokers. Two patients (11%) in the intervention group developed incontinence-associated dermatitis, compared with three (17%) in the control group.
Conclusions: This study reports no significant findings between the two groups. Difficulty in recruitment and feasibility issues might be overcome with changes to inclusion criteria and study design."

Design: Descriptive, multisite epidemiologic survey.
Subjects and setting: The study setting was 29 wards across 4 hospitals, in a hospital trust in the southeast of Norway. Data were collected from 340 patients (age â¥18 years). More than half (56.2%) were 70 years or older (median age category 70-79 years) and 53.3% were male.
Methods: Data collection was conducted in parallel with a pressure injury prevalence study undertaken in 2016. A modified Pressure Injury Prevalence Minimum Data Set, including documentation of fecal or urinary incontinence, use of indwelling fecal collection system or urinary catheter, and presence of IAD, was completed. RNs participating in the study were trained by the researchers on skin assessment and data extraction from the electronic medical record. Descriptive statistics were used for prevalence figures; the Kruskal-Wallis and Ï tests were used to determine associated factors.
Results: Analysis revealed that 16.5% (56 out of 340) of the sample were incontinent. The prevalence of IAD in the total population was 7.6% (26 out of 340). The prevalence of IAD was 29% (16 out of 56) among patients with urinary or fecal incontinence. Of those identified with IAD, 5.2% (18 out of 340) had category 1 (red intact skin) and 2.4% (8 of 340) had category 2 (red skin with breakdown). Bivariate analysis revealed that fecal incontinence (P < .001), immobility (P < .01), and 70 years or older (P < .03) were associated with IAD.
Conclusions: The overall prevalence (patients with and without incontinence) of IAD was lower than reported in prior studies; frequent use of indwelling urinary catheters and a relatively low prevalence of incontinence may explain this finding. Similar to prior studies, almost 1 in 3 patients who were incontinent suffered from IAD, showing a need for evidence-based guidelines to prevent IAD in hospitalized patients. Findings suggest that particular attention should be given to prevent IAD among patients with fecal incontinence patients, 70 years and older, and those with immobility."

It is now established that a number of factors are considered important in the etiology of IND. The principal irritants are fecal enzymes, which damage infant skin and are further amplified by a number of factors, including skin maceration and friction, high pH, the presence of urine, and the duration of contact with feces. In recent years, the decreasing incidence and severity of IND reflects improvements in the design and performance of diapers, diaper skin care products, and overall awareness about maintaining infant skin health."

It probably results due to an interaction of multiple factors like increased wetness, elevated pH due to urine, fecal enzymes and microorganisms under the nappy. It manifests as an erythematous rash occurring on the convex surfaces of skin under the nappy. Rashes resembling nappy dermatitis can also be caused by some diseases which may have serious systemic manifestations. Therefore it is essential to differentiate and treat them. The principle of treatment of diaper dermatitis is to keep the skin in the nappy area as dry as possible with frequent nappy change. The superabsorbent disposable diapers are known to reduce the incidence of diaper dermatitis. Barrier creams to protect the infant's skin and mild topical corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation are mainstays of therapy. The incidence and severity can be reduced by keeping the skin dry under the nappy and protected from irritants and infections."

This is the first of 2 articles focusing on IAD; it updates current research and identifies persistent gaps in our knowledge. Our literature review revealed a small but growing body of evidence that provides additional insight into the epidemiology, etiology, and pathophysiology of IAD when compared to the review generated by the first IAD consensus group convened 5 years earlier. We identified research supporting the use of a defined skin care regimen based on principles of gentle perineal cleansing, moisturization, and application of a skin protectant. Clinical experience also supports application of an antifungal powder, ointment, or cream in patients with evidence of cutaneous candidiasis, aggressive containment of urinary or fecal incontinence, and highly selective use of a mild topical anti-inflammatory product in selected cases. The panel concluded that research remains limited and additional studies are urgently needed to enhance our understanding of IAD and to establish evidence-based protocols for its prevention and treatment."

68,68,Improving diaper design to address incontinence associated dermatitis,2010,BMC Geriatr,Anne-Marie Beguin,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2318-10-86,"Background: Incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD) is an inflammatory skin disease mainly triggered by prolonged skin contact with urine, feces but also liberal detergent use when cleansing the skin. To minimize the epidermal barrier challenge we optimized the design of adult incontinence briefs. In the fluid absorption area we interposed a special type of acidic, curled-type of cellulose between the top sheet in contact with the skin and the absorption core beneath containing the polyacrylate superabsorber. The intention was to minimize disturbance of the already weak acid mantle of aged skin. We also employed air-permeable side panels to minimize skin occlusion and swelling of the stratum corneum.
Methods: The surface pH of diapers was measured after repeated wetting with a urine substitute fluid at the level of the top sheet. Occlusive effects and hydration of the stratum corneum were measured after a 4 hour application of different side panel materials by corneometry on human volunteers. Finally, we evaluated skin symptoms in 12 patients with preexisting IAD for 21 days following the institutional switch to the optimized diaper design. Local skin care protocols remained in place unchanged.
Results: The improved design created a surface pH of 4.6 which was stable even after repeated wetting throughout a 5 hour period. The ""standard design"" briefs had values of 7.1, which is alkaline compared to the acidic surface of normal skin. Side panels made from non-woven material with an air-permeability of more than 1200 l/m2/s avoided excessive hydration of the stratum corneum when compared to the commonly employed air-impermeable plastic films. Resolution of pre-existing IAD skin lesions was noted in 8 out of 12 patients after the switch to the optimized brief design.
Conclusions: An improved design of adult-type briefs can create an acidic pH on the surface and breathable side panels avoid over-hydration of the stratum corneum and occlusion. This may support the epidermal barrier function and may help to reduce the occurrence of IAD."

Data sources: Authors searched Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP Data, Chinese Biomedicine) and English (PubMed, Web of Science) electronic databases for articles published from 1987 through February 2019.
Study selection: The preliminary search identified 558 studies. After removal of duplicates (n = 202), application of exclusion criteria, and screening titles and abstracts (n = 346), 10 studies met the inclusion criteria.
Data extraction: A standardized form was constructed to extract data from eligible studies, and this information was extracted by two independent authors.
Data synthesis: A pooled analysis of the 10 studies (total sample size, 40,039) showed the prevalence of IAD in hospitalized Chinese patients was 1.44% (95% confidence interval, 1.10%-1.79%). Subgroup analysis indicated no significant association between sex and IAD. Patients older than 90 years had the highest incidence of IAD (8.64%). The most common type was mild IAD (1.00%). Fecal incontinence (48.02%) led to more cases of IAD than urinary incontinence (11.35%) or both (25.78%). The most common types of IAD were perineal (0.92%) and perianal (0.90%).
Conclusions: Incontinence-associated dermatitis is a global health problem that requires more attention. Understanding the prevalence and characteristics of IAD is helpful in the formulation of IAD prevention and treatment programs in China."

In healthcare settings, several interventions have been implemented to prevent or manage IAD, and several absorbent products have been developed for incontinent patients; however, there is no systematic review that has reported on which absorbent products are effective for the prevention or management of incontinence-associated dermatitis. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of absorbent products in the prevention and management of IAD.
Methods: MEDLINE (1946-August 31, 2020), CINAHL (1982-August 31, 2020), and Cochrane Library (August 31, 2020) were searched for relevant articles.
Results: Eight studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review, including two randomized controlled trials that were designed to evaluate the efficacy of absorbent products on the prevention or management of incontinence-associated dermatitis. Quality of evidence was assessed as low or very low. The findings revealed that some outcomes related to IAD prevention or improvement of IAD can be positively affected by the introduction of a new absorbent product or a difference in the frequency of pad changing, which can control the overhydration of the skin.
Conclusions: The studies included in this review indicated that the problem of control of overhydration of the skin associated with urine and/or faeces can be controlled by absorbent products and these products may be effective for the prevention or management of incontinence-associated dermatitis. Future research with high-quality studies is required."

IAD is an inflammatory skin condition resulting from repeated and prolonged contact with urine, faeces or both. This study aimed to measure the incidence and clinical characteristics of adult ICU patients with IAD.
Method: This was a prospective observational study conducted over three months in an adult ICU. Included patients were â¥18 years who experienced faecal incontinence during their intensive care admission. Patients were excluded if they had an ileostomy or colostomy, had IAD on admission, or were continent of urine and faeces. Skin inspections were performed every second day on all recruited patients by trained research nurses. Other data were collected from patient medical records.
Results: A total of 37 patients took part in the study. Incidence of IAD was 35.1%; 13 patients who had incontinence developed IAD. The mean time to onset of IAD was 3.69 days, median 3 days (SD: 1.8, range: 2-8 days). Of the 13 patients who developed IAD, 12 (92.3%) patients were initially assessed as having category 1 IAD and one (7.7%) patient was initially assessed with category 2 IAD. Of the patients with category 1 IAD, one patient (7.7%) progressed to category 2 IAD severity.
Conclusion: A larger sample is recommended to fully explore ICU patient characteristics and IAD development. The incidence of IAD in ICU patients was high at 35%, indicating this condition requires due consideration in ICU patients."

The primary aim of this study was to describe the incidence and characteristics of self-reported IAD among community-living individuals with fecal incontinence. The study also examined whether IAD was associated with older age, sex, presence of urinary incontinence, or fecal incontinence severity.
Design: Secondary data analysis was performed using a prospective cohort design.
Subjects and setting: Data were drawn from community-living adults (n = 98) with fecal incontinence (76% female, 34% aged â¥65 years, 90% white) who participated in a study about dietary fiber supplementation and were free of IAD at the start. Thirty five percent also had urinary incontinence.
Methods: Subjects assessed their skin for IAD daily for 52 days, reporting types of IAD damage (redness, rash/fungal infection, and skin loss), location of IAD, and symptoms. They reported fecal incontinence on a diary for the first and last 14 study days.
Results: The incidence of IAD was 41% (40 of the 98). The fecal incontinence severity score for subjects developing IAD was 1.2 higher than those who never had IAD (P < .001). There was no significant association of IAD with age, sex, or dual fecal and urinary incontinence. Incontinence-associated dermatitis developed within 2 weeks and healed in approximately 1 week. The most common sign and symptom were redness (60% patients) and soreness (78% patients), respectively. Most subjects (85%) had IAD in one location.
Conclusions: Assessing for IAD in community-living patients with fecal incontinence is important as IAD is common and causes discomfort. The relatively mild severity of IAD offers WOC nurses the opportunity for improving patient outcomes by preventing and managing this problem."

Background: Patients in the ICU are susceptible to IAD. IAD is painful, reduces the patient's quality of life and adds to the workload of clinical medical staff. However, risk factors associated with IAD may differ between countries and healthcare settings.
Design: Prospective cohort study METHODS: From November 2016 to November 2017, a prospective cohort study was conducted among109 patients in three Class 3, Grade A hospitals (comprising 9 ICUs in total) in Beijing. The Incontinence-associated Dermatitis and Its Severity (IADS) instrument in Chinese was applied to assess IAD. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for IAD.
Results: The study population had 29 community-acquired and 80 nosocomial infections, and 26 (incidence: 23.9%) of these had IAD. On univariate analysis, a significant difference was observed between patients with and without IAD with respect to the following indices: Barthel index, Braden scale score, Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS2002) score, serum albumin level, occurrence of infection, faecal incontinence, frequency of faecal incontinence, stool property and double (faecal and urinary) incontinence and perineal assessment tool (PAT) score (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that three factors entered the regression equation-that is, the Braden Scale Score, serum albumin level and double incontinence. Of these, the Braden Scale Score and serum albumin level were protective factors for IAD. Thus, the higher the Braden Scale Score, the lower the risk of IAD (OR = 0.678, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.494-0.931); a higher level of serum albumin implies a lower risk of IAD, provided it is within the normal range (OR = 0.884, 95%CI = 0.797-0.981). Double incontinence was an independent risk factor for IAD (OR = 10.512, 95% CI = 2.492-44.342).
Conclusion: A higher morbidity of IAD is seen in the ICU. Specific preventive and nursing measures are required to maintain the skin integrity of critically ill patients in daily nursing practice to improve patient quality of life and the quality of nursing care.
Relevance to clinical practice: Incontinence-associated dermatitis is characterised by inflammation and tissue damage due to prolonged/repeated exposure to urine and/or stool. Not every patient with urine and/or stool incontinence develops IAD. Medical staff can use research-based evidence to identify ICU patients at risk of IAD to reduce morbidity and improve health outcomes."

The humid, moist environment under the diaper makes the skin more susceptible to injury from exposure to irritants particularly related to urine and feces. A gentle cleansing routine, frequent diaper changes, and a thick barrier cream help control this condition. Irritant diaper dermatitis should be distinguished from other skin conditions that may develop in this sensitive area."

It is categorised by persistent erythema and can be associated with denudation and/or colonisation and infection. IAD is challenging to treat and affects 3.4-50% of patients. This case series evaluates a novel, elastomeric, advanced skin protectant (3M Cavilon Advanced Skin Protectant) in a UK acute health-care setting, for the management of IAD in patients suffering from moisture-associated skin damage (MASD) in the sacral/genital area.
Method: The patient's skin was assessed by clinicians using the GLOBIAD classification tool at the point of recruitment and to monitor progress throughout the study period. The product was applied as a single layer in accordance with the instructions for use. Patients, when able, were asked to assess their own pain level using the Wong-Baker FACES pain scale. Photographs were taken as part of the ongoing assessment.
Results: The skin protectant was used on average every 2.28 days. Of the 18 IAD patients recruited, 79% (n=11) were classified as IAD-free, based on the GLOBIAD categorisation tool, by the end of the evaluation period. Skin deterioration during the evaluation period was seen in one patient (6%), and of the patients able to complete pain assessments, 55% (n=6) reported a reduction in pain.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the elastomeric skin protectant, applied every three days, plays a role in the improvement of IAD. The skin protectant adheres to wet and weeping partial-thickness wounds and may aid IAD management. Reducing application to every third day supports a change in practice which may offer benefits to patients and caregivers."

However, it is frequently misdiagnosed and poorly treated. There is often uncertainty about which product to use to prevent and treat IAD; the different types, brands and how to apply them. This literature review looks specifically at the use of barrier products in the prevention and treatment of IAD. A systematic search found six primary research papers that analysed the effectiveness of various barrier products; they will be compared and contrasted in this review. There is a lack of evidence to recommend any one barrier product over another for use in a standardised skin care protocol such as the regimen suggested by Gray et al (2012). More research needs to be conducted to establish the most effective barrier products on the market. More research is also needed on the efficacy of barrier products in the prevention and treatment solely of IAD rather than combined studies looking at IAD with pressure ulcers."

Among hospitalized patients, the prevalence rate has been found to be as high as 27%. Exposure to skin surface irritants may be a predictor and the condition, in turn, may be a factor in pressure ulcer risk because skin integrity is compromised. Differential diagnosis, usually based on visual examination, can help determine whether incontinence-associated dermatitis or a pressure ulcer is present. Prevention comprises following a structured skin care regimen that includes gentle cleansing, moisturization, and application of a skin protectant or moisture barrier. Treatment goals include protecting the skin from further exposure to irritants, establishing a healing environment, and eradicating any cutaneous infection. This concise review of relevant literature underscores the scant amount of evidence-based information available and highlights the need for further studies that involve comparing protocol and product efficacy to determine best practice for this oft-encountered condition."
88,88,Shifts in the skin microbiome associated with diaper dermatitis and emollient treatment amongst infants and toddlers in China,2019,Exp Dermatol,Yumei Zheng,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14028,"Background: The microbiological basis of diaper dermatitis has not been clearly elucidated; however, a better understanding of microbial colonization may be vital for developing appropriate therapies.
Methods: Using 16S-rRNA gene sequencing technology, we characterized and compared the bacterial communities obtained from the buttock skin sites of children with diaper dermatitis and from healthy controls. Bacterial diversity in the buttock lesion area and subsequent recovery after emollient treatment have been discussed herein.
Results: In buttock skin of children with or without diaper dermatitis, Staphylococcus and Anaerococcus were predominant in the total skin microbiome. Compared with the healthy group, the overall skin bacterial richness and diversity were higher in children with diaper dermatitis, with the abundance of Proteobacteria being significantly higher. In the diaper dermatitis group, the richness of Enterococcus, Erwinia and Pseudomonas was significantly higher, and the levels of Clostridium and Actinomyces were significantly lower than those in healthy children. Richness of Staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher in the diaper dermatitis group, whereas that of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bifidobacterium longum was lower. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, the dominant species found in buttock skin, were observed to recover earlier after the disease had improved through emollient treatment.
Conclusion: Staphylococcus epidermidis, as skin probiotic bacterium, and B longum, Clostridium butyricum and Lactobacillus ruminis, which are intestinal probiotic bacteria, are significantly decreased in diaper dermatitis lesions. These changes in the buttock skin microflora indicate an imbalance in the microflora and suggest that the intestinal microflora may be undergoing dynamic changes. The results of this study suggest that probiotic bacterial supplementation may be useful in the treatment and prevention of diaper dermatitis."
89,89,[How I treat...diaper dermatitis],2006,Rev Med Liege,F Henry,,"Diaper dermatitis is the most frequent skin disorder of the newborn. Several clinical types are distinguished. The most frequent type results from increased fragility of the newborn buttock skin when covered by diapers. According to the mechanisms involved and the severity of the dermatitis, one can distinguish the intertrigo of the chubby baby, and the so-called ""W"", ""Y"" and ""red panties"" types of diaper dermatitis. When the effects of occlusion are not controlled by adequate absorption by the diapers maceration of the stratum corneum occurs. As a result, degradation of the skin barrier function takes place. In addition, the value of the coefficient of friction of the skin increases with epidermal weakening to rubbing. In addition, fecal enzymes alter urines and skin. Judicious hygiene measures and a correct choice of care and diapers are mandatory. Cutaneous colonisation by microorganisms, in particular the yeasts Candida spp, is the main complication. Adequate preventive and curative measures can combat diaper dermatitis with confidence. A miconazole paste allows to improve the tribological properties of the interface between diapers and the skin. It also corrects the degradation of the skin barrier function, reduces inflammation and abates the impact of Candida spp. in the pathogenesis of the skin disorder."

We aimed to evaluate the effects of moisturizing skincare, including using lotion and reducing routine bathing. Our hypothesis was that moisturizing skincare would improve skin barrier function. This randomized controlled trial included 227 healthy Asian newborns between 1 week and 3 months old. We compared moisturizing skincare (bathing every 2 days and using lotion daily; intervention, n = 113) to daily bathing without lotion (control, n = 114). We assessed the skin barrier function (transepidermal water loss [TEWL], stratum corneum hydration [SCH], skin pH and sebum secretion) as a primary outcome at 3 months old. We also assessed the incidence of skin problems according to parents' diary reports. Compared with the control, the intervention group had a lower face TEWL (mean Â± standard deviation, 14.69 Â± 7.38 vs 17.08 Â± 8.26 g/m2 per h, P = 0.033), higher face SCH (60.38 Â± 13.66 vs 53.52 Â± 14.55, P = 0.001) and higher body SCH (58.89 Â± 12.96 vs 53.02 Â± 10.08, P < 0.001). Compared with the control, newborns in the intervention group had significantly lower rates of diaper dermatitis between birth and 1 month old (6.3% vs 15.9%, P = 0.022), and tended to have lower rates of body skin problems between 1 and 3 months (42.1% vs 55.2%, P = 0.064). Moisturizing skincare was effective for improving skin barrier function and preventing newborns' diaper dermatitis. The results of our study may help parents make informed decisions about newborn skincare."

Many studies describe diaper dermatitis, but lack a full description of clinical characteristic (CC) involvement.
Purpose: The purpose of this literature review is to explore the descriptions of CC of infants with DD provided within infant DD literature.
Search strategy: PubMed and Web of Science were searched using the keywords: diaper dermatitis, diaper rash, infant, and neonate. The inclusion criteria for this project are as follows: published after 1990, English language, include skin assessment or evaluation, and infant/children < two years of age. Review and opinion articles were excluded.
Results: A total of 454 studies were retrieved, 27 remained after review for duplicates and relevance. The CC described most often were: type of feeds, stool frequency, history of DD, use of antibiotics, and delivery mode.
Synthesis of evidence: The studies reported inconsistent CC and a lack of correlation between these characteristics and the condition of diapered skin. Many studies focused solely on the efficacy of interventions lacking description of possible relationships between DD and CC.
Implications for practice: Skin condition outcome variables can be improved with the acknowledgment of the impact CC have on the development of DD. The combination of assessment measures and CC may ultimately demonstrate more merit or rigor for describing DD severity and skin condition.
Implications for research: Future research should expand this exploration to include environmental or contributing factors to continue to identify additional risk factors for DD."

An evidence-based algorithm for prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis was developed and introduced in a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Two cases are discussed as examples of severe diaper dermatitis. The first case demonstrates the final case of severe diaper dermatitis since the introduction of the algorithm. The second case demonstrates a less severe, but equally frustrating, case of diaper dermatitis that occurred after the practice of using the algorithm was established. The need for consistency in the prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis is paramount to providing quality care. There are a number of points within the bedside care regimen where breakdown in consistency occurs. The adherence to consistent and evidence-based treatment regimens has the potential to decrease the incidence and severity of diaper dermatitis in high-risk hospitalized infants. Initiation of an evidence-based algorithm to assist in the prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis can be supported by data of the number of cases of diaper dermatitis collected before and after implementing the algorithm. The information can further assist in continued education and pursuance of investigation of other major skin injuries in NICU patients. The importance surrounding infant skin care and building awareness surrounding all of the facets of skin care in this vulnerable population demonstrate the benefits to quality outcomes and care."

Subjects and setting: Forty-five patients with a mean age of 49.4 Â± 18.5 years (mean Â± SD) in the surgical/trauma critical care unit (ICU) of 1 of 3 urban hospitals who were free of any perineal skin damage at study start participated in the study. The majority (76%) were male.
Methods: Surveillance of skin for IAD and chart review of data initially and daily.
Results: Incontinence-associated dermatitis developed in 36% of patients. The median time to onset of IAD was 4 days (range, 1-6). Eighty-one percent of patients still had IAD at discharge from the ICU and at the end of their surveillance (median time = 7 days, range, 1-19 days). The severity of erythema associated with IAD was mild, moderate, or severe for 13%, 11%, or 4% (means) of the time patients were observed. Denudement occurred 9% of the observed time. Frequent incontinence of loose or liquid stools and diminished cognitive awareness were significant independent risk factors for development of IAD sooner.
Conclusion: Incontinence-associated dermatitis develops in critically ill patients with fecal incontinence relatively quickly and does not resolve in most before their discharge from the ICU. Early monitoring and prevention of IAD, especially in patients with diminished cognition or with frequent leakage of loose or liquid feces, are recommended to promote skin health."

Design: Modified Delphi technique.
Sample and setting: Questionnaires were sent via e-mail to 50 identified experts, with an initial response of 17. Thirteen clinical experts responded to the second round and 11 responded to a third round.
Methods: Items on the questionnaires were investigator-developed. Consensus was defined as 80% or more agreement. Three rounds of questionnaires were employed to attempt consensus. Descriptive statistics were performed using mean and standard deviation for continuous data and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. Qualitative data were analyzed question by question by the primary researcher using content analysis.
Results: Consensus was achieved indicating that individual facilities should regularly collect data about IAD prevalence or incidence. Consensus was not reached about the need to regularly collect data about ITD prevalence or incidence. Panelists also failed to reach consensus that IAD or ITD prevalence or incidence should be incorporated into the NDNQI indicators.
Conclusion: Panelists did not reach consensus that IAD or ITD epidemiologic data should be incorporated on the NDNQI. Additional research is needed, particularly in the area of ITD, before benchmarks can be established regarding these data as nurse-sensitive indicators of quality care."

We also aimed to determine associated evidence-into-practice gaps.
Design: Multisite mixed-methods study.
Subjects and settings: The sample comprised 250 adult patients in 12 units across 4 hospitals; their mean age was 73 years. Nurses caring for the patient at the time of the audit were questioned on nursing practice for patients with incontinence.
Methods: A 2-page audit tool was developed and used to capture demographic data, continence and mobility status, IAD and PI, incontinence products, nursing practice observations, and nurses' comments. Each patient was assessed by 2 senior nurses. Quantitative analysis included descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis using a Ï test to examine the association between mobility and incontinence and a Fisher exact test to examine the association between IAD and PI. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data and develop themes.
Results: Almost half of patients had incontinence (n = 111/250), 20.7% of patients with incontinence (n = 23/111) had IAD, and 6.3% (n = 7/111) had hospital-acquired PI. There was a significant association between incontinence and mobility, and between IAD and PIs. In addition, 22.3% of patients who were continent (31/139) were wearing an incontinence product. Analysis of qualitative data found that both incontinence management and language used to refer to incontinence pads were incompatible with current best practices.
Conclusion: The prevalence of incontinence among patients observed in this study was similar to rates reported internationally, but the prevalence of IAD was slightly lower. The association between IAD and PIs, as well as incontinence and mobility, was statistically and clinically significant. Nurses commonly used interventions with little or no evidence. Hospitals should put measures in place to improve nurses' knowledge of incontinence, IAD, and PI practices."

Settings: Hospitals, nursing homes, home care in Austria and the Netherlands.
Participants: Nursing home residents, hospital patients, home care clients who completed an incontinence assessment and who were incontinent (n = 3713). Mean age 81.2 (SD 11.2) years.
Methods: Demographic, functional and physiological parameters were compared between subjects with incontinence-associated dermatitis and without. A logistic regression model predicting incontinence-associated dermatitis was build.
Results: Subjects with incontinence-associated dermatitis were statistically significantly more often male, had more often diabetes mellitus, had a higher BMI, were less often affected by urinary but more often by faecal incontinence and showed higher degrees of functional and psychical impairments. Being faecal incontinent (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.14-2.55), having diabetes mellitus (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.03-2.06) and having ""friction and shear"" problems (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.51-0.81) according to the Braden scale item were the strongest covariates for the presence of incontinence-associated dermatitis.
Conclusions: It is recommended to target special preventive skin care interventions especially to persons who are faecal incontinent and who have moist perineal skin, who have higher BMIs, who are diabetics, and who need increased assistance in moving."

The aim of this review was to identify and critically appraise the results of published studies on the etiology and pathophysiology of IAD and highlight the current gaps in empirical evidence.
Methods: Scoping literature review.
Search strategy: The electronic databases PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched for relevant articles published from 1996 to April 2018. Thirteen studies and review articles related to the etiology and pathophysiology of IAD were identified in our initial review, and 3 studies published subsequent to our initial review were evaluated and included in our final review.
Findings: These studies suggest that several etiologic factors contribute to the development of IAD including exposure to urine, stool, or a combination of these substances (dual incontinence), the duration and frequency of exposure, frequent cleaning, and inflammatory responses. Results from the current scoping review showed that despite the increasing interest in IAD, evidence related to the underlying mechanisms causing IAD remains sparse. This paucity represents a clear gap in knowledge and indicates a need for additional research.
Implications: Future studies should aim at elucidating: (1) the role of urine and its inherent pH on skin integrity, (2) the role of stool, specific digestive enzymes, and fecal bacteria on skin integrity, (3) the permeability and susceptibility of the skin to damage following frequent cleansing activities and occlusion, and (4) the specific inflammatory response triggered following exposure to urine and fecal matter."

Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of pediatric patients with a diagnosis of persistent diaper dermatitis between August 2015 and November 2017.
Results: The study included 157 patients diagnosed with persistent diaper dermatitis (67 male, 72 female; median age: 13 months). Diaper dermatitis was more common and included the whole perineum in children who had multiple food allergies (P = 0.001). In children with multiple food allergies, the course of diaper dermatitis was more severe, and the condition did not respond to topical treatment (P = 0.025). A longer elimination diet was required for patients with Type I reactions and persistent diaper dermatitis (P = 0.018). In patients with Type II and mixed reactions, diaper dermatitis was more diffuse and covered the whole perineum (P = 0.025). In patients with Type II and mixed reactions, diaper dermatitis was more severe and did not respond to topical treatment (P = 0.025).
Conclusions: Persistent diaper dermatitis lasting longer than a month may be associated with food allergy. The diaper rash may also be the only indicator of the food allergy. Elimination of the responsible food may allow these patients to recover from persistent diaper dermatitis."

Both conditions typically resolve spontaneously; failure to resolve within 1 year warrants evaluation for androgen excess. Neonatal cephalic pustulosis is an acne variant caused by hypersensitivity to Malassezia furfur. It is typically self-limited, but severe cases are managed with topical ketoconazole. Miliaria and milia are caused by sweat retention and present as tiny vesicles or papules; they resolve spontaneously. Contact diaper dermatitis is managed by keeping the diaper area clean and with open air exposure. Diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans is managed with topical antifungals. Seborrheic dermatitis causes scaling on the scalp. Management involves shampooing and removing scales with a soft brush after applying mineral oil or petrolatum; severe cases are managed with tar or ketoconazole shampoo. Atopic dermatitis is related to food allergy in approximately one-third of children. Food allergy can be confirmed with oral food challenges or skin prick tests. Management includes elimination of irritants and triggers and use of low-potency topical steroids."

While traditionally considered an issue only encountered in continence care and older people, it is now recognised that the harmful effects of excessive moisture can occur across the lifespan and in various patient groups. The term 'moisture-associated skin damage' describes the spectrum of inflammatory damage that occurs in response to the prolonged exposure of a patient's skin to perspiration, urine, faeces or wound exudate. It is generally accepted that moisture-associated skin damage consists of four conditions: incontinence-associated dermatitis, intertrigo, peristomal moisture-associated dermatitis, and periwound moisture-associated dermatitis. This article describes the aetiologies of each of the different types of moisture-associated skin damage, and outlines the nursing interventions required for their prevention and management."

The introduction of absorbent gelling materials led to a decrease in skin overhydration and made possible a more beneficial pH in the diaper area. A retrospective evaluation of clinical studies conducted before and after the introduction of absorbent gelling materials confirms that utilization of these materials has been associated with a marked reduction in the severity of diaper dermatitis. More recently, a novel diaper designed to deliver dermatological formulations to the skin also appears to improve the condition of diapered skin. Disposable wipes now are available that are nonirritating and suitable for use on damaged or broken skin. Ongoing innovative efforts in this area promise to further decrease the prevalence of diaper-associated dermatologic conditions."

A 5-step integrative process was used to guide the review. Articles published from January 2000 to April 6, 2017, were identified and retrieved from CINAHL, PubMed, ProQuest (MEDLINE), and Scopus; key terms were associated with IAD, pediatric, prevention, and management. Supplemental and manual searches were carried out to identify other relevant studies. The studies' findings were extracted and summarized in a table of evidence, with their quality evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Checklist. Sixteen articles were included in the review. Articles explored prevention and management strategies including skin cleansing technique, diaper selection, and the application of topical skin care products. Inconsistent and limited evidence was found regarding the benefits of using disposable wipes in preference to water-moistened washcloths in the cleansing process and on the use of superabsorbent polymer diapers with breathable outer lining in IAD prevention. Findings were inconclusive with regard to the best topical skin care product for IAD care. However, the application of skin protectants was encouraged by the authors, as well as promoted in various clinical guidelines. The development of a structured skin care regimen supplemented by a comprehensive patient education program was advised to enhance the prevention and management of IAD."

Design: Descriptive study.
Subjects and setting: The study was conducted in 6 intensive care units of a 550-bed academic research hospital in Turkey. Licensed practical and registered nurses with a minimum of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree employed full-time on these units were invited to participate.
Methods: The survey consisted of statements that examined the demographic characteristics (14 questions) and knowledge levels (59 statements) of the nurses. For each statement, nurses were required to mark only one of the following options: ""correct,"" ""incorrect,"" or ""no knowledge."" Data were collected from July to September 2016. The Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, post hoc multiple comparison test, and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used to analyze the data.
Results: Of the 126 RNs who participated in the study, 46.83% (n = 59) had an undergraduate degree in nursing. The majority (29.37%) practiced in gastroenterology surgery and urology intensive care units. The mean knowledge score was 33.05 Â± 10.16 (min = 0, max = 59). The most correctly answered statement (94.44%; n = 119) was ""The pH of the skin plays a role in skin barrier function."" The statement with the most incorrect or ""no knowledge"" answers (96.03%; n = 120) was ""The natural moisturizing factor found in the structure of corneocytes helps the skin to maintain its oil levels."" Based on correctly answered statements, we found knowledge levels of the prevention and treatment of IAD were higher among nurses with a master of science degree in nursing (40.67 Â± 4.32) and lower among licensed practical nursing (29.12 Â± 10.08) (P < .05).
Conclusion: In this study, knowledge of the nurses on identification, prevention, and treatment of IAD was low. Comprehensive basic nursing education and in-service training programs on IAD are recommended."

These needs include products such as diapers that absorb the excreta, as well as products for cleansing and conditioning the skin. A number of factors play a role in development of diaper dermatitis, including prolonged exposure to excreta, alterations in skin pH or increased hydration, and changes in skin microbial flora. Recent decades have seen great improvements in our understanding of these factors and our ability to develop new and better products to protect baby skin. Better diaper designs and the development of pH-buffered baby wipes have improved the care of skin in the diaper area. Continuing research offers the promise of new products with additional benefits for caregivers and infants."

We examined diaper dermatitis vs within diaper and non-diaper controls over time and characterized the association of skin color and texture relative to skin barrier integrity, hydration, and pH.
Materials and methods: The prospective study included 46 infants with DD at well-child visits. Skin integrity was evaluated over 15 days, including visual skin condition, rate of stratum corneum transepidermal water accumulation, hydration, pH, and skin color and texture from high-resolution digital skin surface images. Effects by site and time were evaluated with general linear models.
Results: Six distinct texture patterns were observed. All three sites differed significantly for texture class frequency. Normal dermatoglyphics were more frequent for non-diaper vs both within diaper and rash sites. Dermatoglyphics with marked furrows or lines (class 3) were common within diaper vs rash but not for non-diaper vs within diaper. Streaks were highest for DD and lowest for non-diaper. Flat regions were more frequent DD. Barrier integrity, that is, moisture accumulation rate, was lower for normal dermatoglyphics than streaks or flat texture. DD severity decreased over 15 days. Barrier properties of within diaper and non-diaper areas were not well-differentiated.
Conclusion: The incidence of streak texture in the within diaper high magnification images was high despite being visually normal. This finding suggests that it is an ""early indicator"" of skin damage and may be clinically useful for early detection and treatment."

Study design: This cross-sectional analysis using nationally representative survey data collected July-August 2017 using a web-based panel examined 981 parents of children between 0 and 3 years of age in the US (response rate, 94%). Survey weighting for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse was used to estimate the prevalence of diaper need and to perform multivariable logistic regression of the association between parent reported diaper need and visits to the pediatrician for diaper rash or urinary tract infections within the past 12 months.
Results: An estimated 36% of parents endorsed diaper need. Both diaper need (aOR 2.37; 95% CI 1.69-3.31) and visiting organizations to receive diapers (aOR 2.14; 95% CI 1.43-3.21) were associated with diaper dermatitis visits. Similar associations were found for diaper need (aOR 2.63; 95% CI 1.54-4.49) and visiting organizations to receive diapers (aOR 4.50; 95% CI 2.63-7.70) for urinary tract infection visits.
Conclusions: Diaper need is common and associated with increased pediatric care visits. These findings suggest pediatric provider and policy interventions decreasing diaper need could improve child health and reduce associated healthcare use."

Methods: A psychometric validation design was employed. Phase I of the study entailed the development of items through an extensive literature review and a double Delphi procedure with 11 experts specialised in wound, ostomy and continence to examine content validity of the KAP-IAD-Q. Phase II involved administering the KAP-IAD-Q to a convenience sample of 263 Registered Nurses from a public hospital in Singapore to evaluate its construct validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability.
Results: The instrument showed acceptable content validity (S-CVI = 0.85). Exploratory factor analysis showed all 22 items demonstrated strong factor loadings >0.4 and the four factors KAP-IAD-Q explained 58.1% of total variance. The four factors wereâ¹1) knowledge om IAD aetiology and identification, (2) knowledge on IAD risk factors; (3) attitudes, and (4) practices.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 1153 participants using structural questionnaires, which was conducted at Khon Kaen University Faculty of Medicine Pediatric department in Thailand. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to test the association between diaper dermatitis and its possible risk factors.
Results: The prevalence of diaper dermatitis among the study population was 36.1%, a rate which significantly decreased with age. The highest prevalence was found in subjects who were one to six months old. Risk factors that had a statistically significant association with diaper dermatitis in both univariate and multivariate analysis were i) diaper changing fewer than three times/night, ii) previous episodes of diaper rash, iii) using cloth diapers, and iv) topical application of baby talcum powder to the diaper area.
Conclusions: Frequent diaper changings during the daytime do not compensate for fewer changings during the night. Moreover, the use of baby talcum powder on the diaper area significantly increased the risk of diaper dermatitis among the study population. These findings should be applied in future preventive strategies for diaper dermatitis in this age group."

Typically IAD presents as inflammation of the skin surface characterised by redness, and in extreme cases, swelling and blister formation. If untreated this usually rapidly leads to excoriation and skin breakdown, which may subsequently become infected by the skin flora. While this is a common condition encountered in all areas of nursing practice, gaps remain in our understanding of the many contributing factors. A lack of standardised definitions of IAD, differences in terminology, and a bewildering increase in products available to prevent and manage IAD, makes it difficult for nurses to deliver evidence-based care. However, it is an area where nursing research has made a considerable contribution over the past few years.

A thorough history nd physical examination for each patient can aid in the diagnosis; however, if clinically suspicious for LCH, a punch biopsy should be performed. Histologic evaluation of LCH is often enough to differentiate it from the many clinical mimickers. Characteristic findings include a histiocytic infiltrate with ""coffee bean""-cleaved nuclei, rounded shape, and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical stains, including CD1a, S100, and CD207 (langerin) are often needed for a definitive diagnosis. Electron microscopy also demonstrates the ultrastructural presence of Birbeck granules, but this is no longer needed due to immunohistochemical staining.

It has a serious effect on children's and families' quality of life. We aimed to screen and evaluate the efficacy of different formulas for relieving the diaper dermatitis symptoms by developing a kind of diaper dermatitis-like reconstructed human skin equivalent in vitro.
Materials and method: We developed the human skin equivalent for diaper dermatitis with 0.2% Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). The diaper dermatitis-like human skin equivalent was characterized by high level of inflammation, such as overexpression of interleukin-1Î± (IL-1Î±), and impaired skin barrier. Four formulas with potential of anti-inflammation and promotion of skin barrier function were topically applied on the diaper dermatitis-like human skin equivalent surface. The afterward protection efficacy was evaluated by endpoints of IL-1Î±, tissue viability, and skin barrier function.
Results: The chemical irritant induced high release of IL-1Î±, impaired tissue viability, and skin barrier function. The cream prepared with potential of anti-inflammation and skin protection could effectively decrease and relive the impact of irritant with decreased level of IL-1Î± and the higher tissue viability than the placebo exposure.
Conclusion: The results showed that diaper dermatitis-like human skin equivalent induced by SLS can mimic the skin irritation response of the diaper rash."

Participants and setting: The QI setting was an 18-bed surgical intensive care unit (SICU) in an acute care urban hospital located in the southeastern United States. Two hundred eleven patients participated in this pre/postintervention QI project.
Approach: The algorithm for skin care used evidence-based bundled interventions for patients with fecal and urinary incontinence. The project comprised education of the SICU nursing staff in January 2018 and implementation of the algorithm from February 5, 2018, to June 5, 2018. Weekly chart reviews were conducted to determine algorithm compliance, documentation of fecal and urinary incontinence, and accuracy of IAD documentation. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the rate of hospital-acquired IAD, algorithm compliance, and average length of time from admission to the onset of hospital-acquired IAD.
Outcomes: Seventy-nine individuals with incontinence were included in the 3-month preintervention period and 132 individuals with incontinence in the 3-month postintervention period. We observed a 24% reduction in the rate of hospital-acquired IAD following implementation of the algorithm (29% vs 5%). The average length of time from admission to the onset of hospital-acquired IAD increased from 15 days in February 2018 to 25 days in May 2018.
Implications for practice: Our experience with this QI project suggest that IAD can be identified and managed at the bedside by first clinical nursing staff without expertise in skin assessment and wound care."

Design: This was a descriptive, retrospective-cohort observational study.
Subjects and setting: The sample comprised 417 adults admitted to an urban community hospital licensed for 249 acute and 52 acute rehabilitation beds in Charleston, South Carolina, and referred to WOC nurses for evaluation and treatment.
Methods: Prevalence and incidence rates were calculated from data previously collected for quality improvement purposes from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, by the WOC nurses and documented in a secure, password-protected electronic spreadsheet. The prevalence of IAD/ITD was calculated as the proportion of patients diagnosed with IAD/ITD on admission to our facility. The incidence of IAD and ITD was calculated as percentage of patients who developed IAD/ITD during the course of their hospital stay. All units in the hospital were included.
Results: The mean prevalence of IAD present on admission was 16%; the prevalence decreased over the data collection period; it was 21% in 2014, 15% in 2015, and 13% in 2016. The mean incidence of hospital-acquired IAD during the data collection period was 23%; the highest rate (26%) occurred in 2016. Patients classified as normal weight from their body mass index and patients 60 years and older had the highest incidence of hospital-acquired IAD. The mean prevalence of ITD for patients admitted to the hospital was 40% for the 3-year time; annual rates varied from a low of 36% in 2015 to a high of 42% in 2016. The mean incidence of hospital-acquired ITD was 33% over the data collection period; mean incidence rates were 32% in 2014, 39% in 2015, and 29% in 2016. The incidence of ITD was higher in patients classified as obese based on body mass index in patients 60 years and older. The most common location was the gluteal cleft.
Conclusions: The prevalence of IAD fell within the range of prior epidemiologic studies, but the facility-acquired IAD incidence rates were higher than other studies based in the acute care setting. The prevalence of ITD was higher than rates reported in prior studies; we searched the literature and found no previous reports of ITD occurrences over the course of a hospital stay. Additional research regarding IAD prevention and ITD in the gluteal cleft is needed. Data collection regarding IAD and ITD prevalence and incidence could be incorporated into the data collection tool used for pressure injury data collection for the National Database of Nursing Sensitive Indicators."

137,137,Etiology and pathophysiology of diaper dermatitis,1988,Adv Dermatol,R W Berg,,"Common diaper dermatitis is a group of skin disorders that result from attack of the skin by physical, chemical, enzymatic, and microbial factors in the diaper environment. The integrity of healthy skin is compromised by the very nature of the diaper environment, and normal intact skin therefore remains an elusive goal of current diapering practices. Moist occlusion promotes miliaria, and causes an increase in the coefficient of skin friction. Skin hydration and an increase in skin pH result in impaired barrier function, and fecal enzymes begin to attack the skin, further degrading its normal ability to cope with its environment. Skin in this weakened state is susceptible to a variety of biological, chemical, and physical insults that can cause or aggravate diaper dermatitis. These include attack of the skin by fecal enzymes and other irritants in urine and feces, mechanical abrasion, and infection by C. albicans. Diapering is unquestionably an effective and convenient way of localizing an infant's excreta. Unfortunately, infant skin was not designed to operate continuously in the resulting environment, and is frequently unable to weather this assault. However, by improving the inherently adverse relationship between diapers and diapered skin, one can have a significant effect on the incidence and severity of diaper dermatitis. A diaper that keeps skin drier will result in skin that is less permeable to irritants, supports less microbial growth, is less susceptible to chafing damage, and has less contact with irritants in urine and feces. A diaper that maintains the environment closer to the normal acidic pH of skin will promote skin that is less permeable to irritants, and reduce the irritancy of fecal enzymes. Finally, a diaper that limits the mixing and spreading of urine and feces will result in less potentiation of enzyme activity and less contact of the skin with fecal irritants. Diaper dermatitis, by definition, cannot exist in the absence of diapers. Moreover, diaper dermatitis will become less troublesome for the infant population to the degree that diapered skin can be provided an environment closer to that of undiapered skin."

Methods: A prospective, non-equivalent, two group comparative design within three hospital medical units. Pre- and post-implementation skin condition documentation were compared by clinician type, and post-implementation IADSI scores were assessed for agreement using standard and weighted Kappa.
Results: Of 89 patients (pre-, n=48 and post-, n=38), mean (standard deviation) age was 72.4Â±13.7 years and 57.3% had IAD. Mean IADSI score was 13.2 (standard deviation: 10.5; range: 0-52), reflecting pink intact skin. Post-implementation, skin documentation between clinicians was more likely to match, from 35.4 to 84.2%, p<0.001. Post-implementation, after controlling for age, gender and race, the odds ration (OR) of matched documentation between clinicians was 5.80 ([95% confidence interval: 1.8, 18.6], p=0.003) compared with pre-implementation. In the post-implementation period, standard Kappas for agreement in clinical nurse-wound expert documentation in the lower back/buttocks/upper thigh areas ranged from 0.82 to 1.0, reflecting very good agreement. Weighted kappas ranged from 0.76 to 1.0, also reflecting good to very good agreement.
Conclusion: Implementation of an IADSI assessment instrument improved accuracy of IAD documentation."

The past decade has seen a huge growth in publications focusing on the complexity and inconsistency of the clinical observation of IAD and the differentiation between IAD and pressure ulcers. IAD and superficial pressure ulcers cause confusion in clinical practice when trying to determine the true nature and underlying pathology of the lesion. It is a daily challenge for health professionals in hospitals, nursing homes and community care to maintain a healthy skin in patients with incontinence. The aim of this article is to provide a brief update on recent developments regarding the differentiation between pressure ulcers and IAD and the prevention of IAD. Recommendations for clinical practice and research are provided."

A Classification and Regression Tree Analysis,2021,Adv Skin Wound Care,Manuela Hoedl,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.asw.0000722752.86631.af,"Objective: To investigate which characteristics of fecal incontinence (FI) are predictors for incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) using the Classification and Regression Tree method.
Design and setting: Data collected from 2014 to 2016 during the Austrian Nursing Quality Measurement 2.0, an annually conducted, cross-sectional, multicenter prevalence study, were merged and analyzed.
Main outcome measure: The duration, frequency, and amount of FI were used as predictors for IAD. Nurses were asked if the participants suffered from IAD based on their clinical judgment (yes/no).
Main results: In total, 1,513 participants with FI were included in this analysis. More than 75% of the participants with FI were to a great extent or completely care dependent. Of all FI participants, nearly 6% suffered from IAD, and more than 70% received special skin care for IAD prevention. Participants with FI had the highest risk of developing IAD if they experienced FI every day, had FI for less than 3 months, and had developed the FI in their current institution.
Conclusions: Nurses face many challenges while helping patients with FI maintain healthy skin. Knowledge of the results of this study and accumulated knowledge about the specific characteristics of FI that are associated with the development of IAD can help healthcare personnel prevent IAD. Based on these results, improving patient education for persons with newly diagnosed FI to prevent IAD is recommended. Research studies should use the definition of FI established by the International Continence Society."

However, it remains unclear whether incontinence predisposes a patient to increased Candida colonisation or whether incontinence acts as a trigger for Candida infection in those already colonised. The purpose of this observational cross-sectional study was to estimate colonisation rates of C. albicans in continent, compared to incontinent patients, and patients with incontinence-associated dermatitis. Data were collected on 81 inpatients of a major Australian hospital and included a pelvic skin inspection and microbiological specimens to detect C. Albicans at hospital admission. The mean age of the sample was 76 years (SD = 12.22) with 53% being male. Incontinent participants (n = 53) had a non-significant trend towards greater Candida colonisation rates at the perianal site (43% versus 28%) Ï2 (1, N = 81) = 4Â·453, p = Â·638 and the inguinal site (24% versus 14%) Ï2 (1, N = 81) = 6Â·868, p = Â·258 compared to continent patients (n = 28). The incontinent subgroup with incontinence-associated dermatitis (n = 22) showed no difference in colonisation rates compared to those without incontinence-associated dermatitis. Understanding the epidemiology of colonisation may have implications for the prevention of Candida infection in these patients."

A published international guideline and the Ghent Global IAD Categorisation Tool (GLOBIAD) outline the best available evidence for the optimal management of IAD. This study aims to implement theguideline and the GLOBIAD tool and evaluate the effect on IAD occurrences and sacral pressure injuries as well as patient, clinician and cost-effectiveness outcomes.
Materials and methods: The study will employ a multi-method design across six hospitals in five health districts in Australia, and will be conducted in three phases (pre-implementation, implementation and post-implementation) over 19 months. Data collection will involve IAD and pressure injury prevalence audits for patient hospital admissions, focus groups with, and surveys of, clinicians, patient interviews, and collection of the cost of IAD hospital care and patient-related outcomes including quality of life. Eligible participants will be hospitalised adults over 18 years of age experiencing incontinence, and clinicians working in the study wards will be invited to participate in focus groups and surveys.
Conclusion: The implementation of health district-wide evidence-based practices for IAD using a translational research approach that engages key stakeholders will allow the standardisation of IAD care that can potentially be applicable to a range of settings. Knowledge gained will inform future practice change in patient care and health service delivery and improve the quality of care for patients with IAD. Support at the hospital, state and national levels, coupled with a refined stakeholder-inclusive strategy, will enhance this project's success, sustainability and scalability beyond this existing project."

IAD is caused by increased, unrelieved moisture against the skin, usually from liquid faeces and urine, which can then weaken the skin integrity. The integrity of the skin in this area is also at risk of pressure ulcers caused by shear or friction ( Beeckman et al, 2010a ). Treatment and prevention of IAD lesions involves a three-step process used in post-incontinence episodes, which includes cleansing, moisturisation and protection of the skin ( Beeckman et al, 2011a ). Using a wipe covers all of these steps immediately following incontinence episodes ( RÃ¶nner et al, 2010 ). This reduces the need to gather a number of different items required for post-incontinence skin care, which usually includes a dry wipe to be soaked in soapy water to wash the skin, a moisturiser to replace lost moisture and a skin protectant to prevent moisture from direct contact with the skin ( Foxley and Baadjies, 2009 ). This article will give some examples of the use of a particular continence and cleansing wipe in clinical practice."

While traditional treatments, such as skin protectants including ointment or cream-based products, cyanoacrylate-based monomers, and wicking agents, help some patients, those with moderate to severe cases require more aggressive treatments to accelerate healing.
Case series: This article describes a series of 4 hospitalized patients who presented with moderate to severe IAD and/or ITD with and without fungal infections. These patients were treated with therapies that went beyond routine skin care regimens, which included treatment with a combination of 0.25% acetic acid, a topical steroid agent, or a topical antifungal when necessary. The patients included a 74-year-old woman admitted with hypovolemic shock, an 82-year-old obese woman with pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, an 80-year-old woman with medically complicated obesity, and a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman admitted with sepsis.

Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the Candida spp. colonisation and efficacy of camphorated oil in the skin care of the patients with incontinence-associated dermatitis.
Materials and methods: In patients of the study group (n=104), a local application of camphorated oil was used to clean and protect their skin from urine and/or faeces. In 30 patients of the control group routine wet wipes 3 in 1 or a combination of cleansing foam with protective cream were used. Pre-treatment (day 1) and post-treatment (day 30Â±1) study evaluations included detailed description of eruption, assessment by evaluation tools, and mycological culture for Candida spp. from sites with fungal-appearing rash.
Results: Fungal-appearing rash was found in almost a half (51.0%) of patients at pre-treatment examination and in less than one-third (31.7%) of the patients after the course of application of camphorated oil. Candida spp. was cultivated in 39 (37.5%) patients. Fungal-appearing rash was approved by mycological culture in 56.6%. In patients with urine incontinence, Candida spp. negative cases (43.3%) were significantly prevalent over Candida spp. positive (22.1%). At post-treatment, this prevalence become more noticeable, accordingly obtaining 62.5% of negative and 2.9% of positive results. In patients with double incontinence, Candida spp. negative cases (19.2%) were almost equal to the number of Candida spp. positive (15.4%). After a course of study treatment, Candida spp. negative cases (26.0%) significantly overpassed Candida spp. positive level (8.7%). At an early and moderate grade of IAD Candida spp. negative cases were prevalent, but at severe grade did not differ from the number of positive mycology cultures.
Conclusions: The topical use of camphorated oil in skin care of the incontinence-associated dermatitis significantly decreases the severity of disease, reduces fungal appearing rash and Candida spp. colonisation. Camphorated oil was superior to routine products in the controlling of yeast colonisation of the skin in incontinence-associated dermatitis, especially in cases with double incontinence."

Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of moisture associated skin damage and associated factors among Norwegian intensive care patients.
Methods: A multi-centre one-day point-prevalence study.
Results: Totally, 112 patients participated in the study. Overall, 15 patients (13%, 15/112) had some type of moisture associated skin damage of which six cases (5%, 6/112) were related to faeces and/or urine (incontinence associated dermatitis). Skin breakdown occurred primarily in the pelvic area. Overall, 87% (97/112) had an indwelling urinary catheter. Stools were reported in 42% (47/112) of the patients on the study day, mostly liquid or semi-liquid. Overall, 11% (12/112) had a faecal management system. Only a few care plans for moisture associated skin damage prevention and care existed.
Conclusion: Patients in this study were vulnerable to skin breakdown in the pelvic area. Nevertheless, a low prevalence of skin breakdown existed. This may relate to intensive care nurses' qualifications, the 1:1 nurse-patient staffing, the high prevalence of urinary catheters and few patients having stools."
153,153,The impact of diaper design on mitigating known causes of diaper dermatitis,2018,Pediatr Dermatol,Jennifer Gustin,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.13680,"Background: Diapers play a critical role in infant health. In addition to providing sanitary methods of disposing of urine and feces, they can also directly impact skin health. Prolonged exposure to wetness and fecal matter has been shown to be a key driver of diaper dermatitis. This study sought to evaluate how diaper construction can affect absorption of stool.
Methods: Methods included laboratory testing of stool absorbency as well as an at-home diaper evaluation study, which examined a diaper's ability to keep fecal matter from the skin. Breastfed infant stool was given special consideration, as its properties make it difficult to contain.
Results: Laboratory results demonstrated that a meshlike aperture diaper was better able to absorb fecal matter. The at-home diaper evaluation study confirmed that a meshlike aperture diaper design resulted in fewer instances of stool being present on skin during diaper changes.
Conclusion: Diapers with a meshlike aperture topsheet may represent a better way to mitigate known causes of diaper dermatitis through their superior ability to absorb fecal matter."

Review method used: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources: A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane library, China Biology Medicine (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and WeiPu. All the databases were searched from their inception to July 31, 2019, and the data were updated on November 2, 2019.
Review methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies were included. Participants were critically ill patients with faecal incontinence, and the interventions involved care with faecal collection devices. Comparisons were usual care, and the outcome was the incidence of IAD. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to calculate the pooled effect sizes. Heterogeneity was tested using the inconsistency index (I2) method.
Results: Nineteen studies were included in this systematic review including 16 RCTs and three quasi-experimental studies. Twelve RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, which showed that the use of faecal collection devices significantly reduced the incidence of IAD. Subgroup analyses based on device type showed significant effects for anal pouch collection devices (OR, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.26; P < 0.00001), anal pouch connected to negative-pressure suction devices (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.42; P < 0.00001), anal catheter/tube collection devices (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13-0.44; P < 0.00001), and anal catheter/tube connected to negative-pressure suction devices (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.59, P < 0.00001).
Conclusions: Faecal collection devices can reduce the incidence of IAD in critically ill patients with faecal incontinence. It is suggested that when using a device to care for critically ill patients with faecal incontinence, an anal pouch connected to continuous low-negative-pressure suction device should be preferred. Further high-quality research is still needed regarding anal catheter/tube collection devices and anal catheter/tube connected to continuous low-negative-pressure suction devices."

Methods: Teams of two nurses working independently assessed the skin of each inpatient who consented to having their skin observed.
Results: Over 28 September 2015 to 2nd October 2015, 8365 patients were assessed across 66 hospitals with 748 (8.9%) found to have pressure ulcers. Not all patients had their skin inspected with all mental health patients exempt from this part of the audit along with others who did not consent or were too ill. Of the patients with pressure ulcers, 593 (79.3%) had their skin inspected with 158 new pressure ulcers encountered that were not known to ward staff, while 152 pressure ulcers were incorrectly categorised by the ward teams. Incontinence-associated dermatitis was encountered in 360 patients (4.3%), while medical device-related pressure ulcers were rare (n=33). The support surfaces used while patients were in bed were also recorded to provide a baseline against which future changes in equipment procurement could be assessed. The presence of other wounds was also recorded with 2537 (30.3%) of all hospital patients having one or more skin wounds.
Conclusions: This survey has demonstrated that although complex, it is feasible to undertake national surveys of pressure ulcers, incontinence-associated dermatitis and other wounds providing comprehensive and accurate data to help plan improvements in wound care across Wales."

Methods: A cross-sectional study of 1791 babies (~600 from each country) was recruited at each clinical site. Based on regional toilet-training habits, exclusively diaper-wearing infants were recruited between ages 2-8 months in China and 2-18 months in the USA and Germany. DD was measured, as well as skin pH, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and relative humidity (RH) in the diapered region. Caregiver habits were collected via a questionnaire and included information on hygienic practices.
Results: Diaper dermatitis was highest in the perianal area, followed by the intertriginous, genital, and buttock regions. In general, DD was significantly lower in babies in China, highest in Germany, and intermediate in the USA. This rank ordering of DD by geography was also observed in baby age 2-8 months. The lower DD observed in China was associated with lower skin pH and TEWL on diapered skin and decreased RH in the diaper. Chinese caregivers had the highest rate of prophylactic topical product usage, the most robust cleaning of the diapered area, lack of cleansing after urine-only diaper changes, and Chinese infants spent the least time in an overnight diaper.
Conclusions: These data suggest caregiver behaviors including prophylactic use of topical products, thorough cleaning after stooling and reduced time in an overnight diaper are associated with less DD, lower superficial skin pH, and enhanced skin barrier."

Background: Diaper dermatitis is the most common dermatological condition in newborns who are cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit. Recently, there are several kinds of complementary skincare methods suggested for newborns, such as sunflower oil, human breast milk, etc. Also, some chemical formulations are still being used in many neonatal intensive care units.
Design: Randomised controlled, prospective, experimental.
Methods: This study was carried out with a population including term and preterm newborns who developed diaper rash while being treated in the neonatal intensive care unit of a university hospital in Istanbul between February-October 2010. On completion of the research, a total of 63 newborns from human breast milk (n = 30) and barrier cream (n = 33) groups were contacted.
Results: Genders, mean gestation weeks, feeding method, antibiotic use, diaper area cleansing methods, diaper brands and prelesion scores of newborns in both groups were found to be comparable (p > 0Â·05). There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.294) between the groups in terms of mean number of clinical improvement days, but postlesion score of the barrier cream group was statistically significantly lower (p = 0Â·002) than the human breast milk group.
Conclusion: Barrier cream delivers more effective results than treatment with human breast milk, particularly in the treatment of newborns with moderate to severe dermatitis in the result of the study.
Relevance to clinical practice: This study will shed light on nursing care of skin for newborns who are treated in neonatal intensive care unit."

Methods: Investigators consulted 2 certified WOC nurse experts to determine face validity of the instrument. Seven additional certified WOC nurses evaluated the tool for content validity. The instrument was tested for interrater reliability by attendees at the 2007 WOCN Society National Conference and employees at a health care system in Minnesota. Criterion validity was determined by comparing IAD severity scores of testers with those of the 2 WOC experts and PI.
Results: Consultants determined that the instrument had face and content validity. Two hundred forty-seven attendees at the WOCN Society's National Conference (mean nursing experience 25Â±9 years [meanÂ±SD]), 100 nursing staff in Minnesota: 84 staff nurses (mean nursing experience 17Â±12 years), and 16 nursing assistants (mean nursing experience 7Â±7 years) determined that the instrument has content validity. There were no significant differences in scores of IAD severity for the 4 cases among the 3 types of testers (P>.05). Overall agreement between the 347 raters and the experts using intraclass correlation was 0.98 (P=.006).
Conclusion: The Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis and its Severity Instrument demonstrated good validity and interrater reliability and its development fulfills an unmet need in both research and clinical practice settings."

Through innovation and enhanced technology, their design, composition and performance have been dramatically upgraded from their early forms, and they have transformed the lives of millions of people, improving their quality of life. Skin health related to the use of absorbent hygiene products has accordingly also greatly improved. Still, the wearing of absorbent hygiene products will affect the skin, and for some users the changes in microclimate, mechanical interactions and the exposure to urine and faeces may result in irritant contact dermatitis, i.e. diaper dermatitis (DD) or incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). Babies with developing skin and the elderly with deteriorating skin functions who are the most frequent users of absorbent hygiene products are more vulnerable to the causal factors. Although irritant reactions are the most common, allergic contact dermatitis should be considered if a DD/IAD fails to improve by recommended actions. There is also a connection between IAD and pressure ulcer development of which it is important to be aware.

While partial-thickness burns are often managed with topical therapies, daily dressing changes, patient positioning, hydration, nutrition, and pain management, deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burn injuries require surgical excision and, ultimately, skin grafting. The elderly and very young as well as those with medical comorbidities can develop urinary and fecal incontinence. Urinary ammonia and gastrointestinal lipolytic enzymes and proteases can produce caustic damage to weakened elderly or immature skin. In this report, 2 cases of IAD are presented as chemical burns. After a prolonged interval of urinary and fecal incontinence, an incapacitated 65-year-old male with 14% total body surface area (TBSA) partial-thickness wounds, and an 85-year-old female with 4% TBSA full-thickness wounds were admitted to the burn center and underwent operative management."

Data on 376 inpatients were collected over 2 days at a major Australian teaching hospital. The mean age of the sample group was 62 years and 52% of the patients were male. The prevalence rate of incontinence was 24% (91/376). Urinary incontinence was significantly more prevalent in females (10%) than males (6%) (Ï(2) = 4Â·458, df = 1, P = 0Â·035). IAD occurred in 10% (38/376) of the sample group, with 42% (38/91) of incontinent patients having IAD. Semi-formed and liquid stool were associated with IAD (Ï(2) = 5Â·520, df = 1, P = 0Â·027). Clinical indication of fungal infection was present in 32% (12/38) of patients with IAD. Absorbent disposable briefs were the most common incontinence aids used (80%, 70/91), with soap/water and disposable washcloths being the clean-up products most commonly available (60%, 55/91) at the bedside. Further data are needed to validate this high prevalence. Studies that address prevention of IAD and the effectiveness of management strategies are also needed."

This study aimed to examine the influences of lipidolytic enzymes and/or proteases on skin barrier and tissue structure on the development of incontinence-associated dermatitis. Two animal experiments, ex vivo and in vivo, were performed using rats to examine the influences of 3 factors (maceration, proteases, and lipidolytic enzymes) alone or in various combinations on the barrier function and histology of the skin. As a result, skin treatments, including both of the skin maceration and proteases application, caused erythrocyte leakage from the blood vessels in the dermis. The erythrocyte leakage was observed in a larger area in the skin treated with proteases and lipidolytic enzymes with maceration than in the skin treated with proteases with maceration, that is, the addition of lipidolytic enzymes to skin maceration with proteases enhanced erythrocyte leakage. Lipidolytic enzymes in macerated skin are factors that accelerate tissue damage via skin barrier impairment, and proteases are the factors that trigger the development of incontinence-associated dermatitis via tissue damage. Advanced nursing care of perineal skin in patients with faecal incontinence is required because of the deleterious influence of lipidolytic enzymes and proteases."

Thus, IDD presents an ongoing therapeutic challenge for parents, family physicians, pediatricians, and dermatologists. This article will focus on practical management strategies for IDD."
167,167,[How I explore ... diaper dermatitis],2004,Rev Med Liege,C Flagothier,,"Diaper dermatitis is a frequent condition. Several clinical types are distinguished. The most frequent type results from increased fragility of the newborn buttock skin when covered by diapers. According to the mechanisms involved and the severity of the dermatitis, one can distinguish the intertrigo of the chubby baby, and the so-called ""W"", ""Y"" and ""red panties"" types of diaper dermatitis. When the effects of occlusion are not controlled by adequate absorption by the diapers, hyperhydration of the stratum corneum occurs and progresses to maceration. As a result, the value of the coefficient of friction of the skin increases with epidermal weakening to rubbing. In addition, fecal enzymes (urease, proteases and lipases) alter urines and skin. Judicious hygiene measures and the correct choice of diapers are mandatory. Cutaneous colonization by microorganisms, the most important of which being Candida albicans, is the main complication. Adequate preventive and curative measures can combat diaper dermatitis with confidence. A miconazole paste allows to improve the tribological properties of the interface between diapers and the skin. It also abates the impact of Candida albicans in the pathogenesis of the skin disorder."

A six-month, prospective, double-blind study was conducted in day-care centers in Houston, Texas, to determine the frequency of diarrhea, antibiotic use, and diaper dermatitis in infants and toddlers wearing conventional (cellulose-only core) disposable diapers or disposable diapers with a core of absorbent gelling material (AGM) and cellulose. A questionnaire was administered weekly to the day-care staff to gather health information, and weekly visual examinations were made of children for diaper dermatitis. The frequency of diarrhea was 1.9 episodes per child-year and that of antibiotic use was 3.3 courses per child-year. Infants diapered in disposable diapers with AGM had a significantly (P 0.032) lower mean grade of diaper dermatitis during diarrhea episodes and a lower (P 0.054) mean grade during antibiotic use, compared to those diapered in conventional disposable diapers. There was no significant difference between groups with regard to isolation of Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans from superficial skin cultures of the diapered area. The results indicate that diarrhea and antibiotic use occur frequently in children in day-care centers, and that the severity of diaper dermatitis is less in children wearing AGM disposable diapers than those wearing conventional disposable diapers in that setting."

Methods: The study used a before and after design and was conducted in an adult intensive care unit of an Australian quartenary referral hospital. Data, collected by trained research nurses, included demographic and clinical variables, skin assessment, incontinence-associated dermatitis presence and severity. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
Results: Of the 207 patients enrolled, 146 patients were mechanically ventilated and incontinent thus eligible for analysis, 80 with 768days of observation in the after/intervention group and 66 with 733days of observation in the before group. Most patients were men, mean age 53 years. Groups were similar on demographic variables. Incontinence-associated dermatitis incidence was lower in the intervention group (15%; 12/80) compared to the control group (32%; 21/66) (p=0.016). Incontinence-associated dermatitis events developed later in the intensive care unit stay in the intervention group (Logrank=5.2, p=<0.022).
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the use of a bundle combining best available evidence reduced the incidence and delayed the development of incontinence-associated dermatitis occurrences in critically ill patients. Systematic ongoing patient assessments, combined with tailored prevention measures are central to preventing incontinence-associated dermatitis in this vulnerable patient group."

It is a condition which causes considerable parental anxiety. To better understand the frequency of diaper dermatitis, treatment practices, and the current importance of previously identified etiologic factors, a questionnaire survey of parents who had children wearing diapers (n = 532) attending a large United Kingdom district general hospital was undertaken. At the time of survey, only 16% of the study population had diaper dermatitis. Forty-eight percent of the study population had never had an episode of diaper dermatitis. In a multivariate analysis, current diaper dermatitis was independently associated with four factors: presence of oral thrush, number of previous episodes, frequency of diaper changes, and diarrhea. Recurrent episodes of diaper dermatitis were associated with increasing age, lack of barrier cream use, current diaper rash, and frequency of diaper changes. In the majority of children with diaper dermatitis at the time of survey, treatment had been instituted in the community.

This study was a clinical trial of 30 infants between 0-12 months of age that were suffering from diaper dermatitis and referred to the Health Centers in Tehran, Iran. The subjects were selected by open study. Infants were divided into two matched groups: case and control. Data-gathering tools were the questionnaire that contained two parts: the demographic characteristics of infants and the status of care and condition of the lesion. Data analysis was performed using SPSS/18 software and Mann-Whitney and Chi-Square tests were used. The findings revealed a significant difference between the case and control groups in the number and lesion score of the rashes at the first and third day (P=0.013, P=0.005), these differences were more significant at the fifth day (P=0.004, P=0.001). Because of positive effects of breast milk on healing of diaper dermatitis, it is proposed that educational programs in health centers should be considered by health officials, and the managers would play a key role in increasing knowledge behavior changes in mothers."

The presence of moisture and digestive enzymes (lipase, protease) negatively influences skin barrier function. Additional risk factors will make some patients even more vulnerable than others. In order to provide (cost) effective prevention, this specific patient population should be identified timely.
Objectives: To identify independent risk factors for the development of IAD category 2 (skin loss) in critically ill patients with fecal incontinence.
Design: A cross-sectional observational study.
Setting and participants: The study was performed in 48 ICU wards from 27 Belgian hospitals. Patients of 18 years or older, with fecal incontinence at the moment of data collection, were eligible to participate. Patients with persistent skin redness due to incontinence (IAD category 1) were excluded.
Methods: Potential risk factors were carefully determined based on literature and expert consultations. Data were collected over a period of eight months by trained researchers using patient records and observation of skin care practices. At the time a patient was included in the study, all relevant data from the past six days, or since admission at the ICU, were recorded. Simultaneously, direct skin observations were performed and high definition photographs were ratified by an expert IAD researcher. A multiple binary logistic regression model was composed to identify independent risk factors. Variables with P < .25 in single binary logistic regression analyses were added to the multiple model using a forward procedure. A cut-off value of P < .1 was established to retain variables in the final model. Nagelkerke's R2 and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic were calculated as measures of model fit.
Results: The sample comprised of 206 patients, of which 95 presented with IAD category 2, and 111 were free of IAD. Seven independent risk factors were identified: liquid stool [odds ratio (OR) 4.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.28-9.62], diabetes (OR 2.89; 95% CI 1.34-6.27), age (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.08), smoking (OR 2.67; 95% CI 1.21-5.91), non-use of diapers (OR 2.97; 95% CI 1.39-6.33), fever (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.23-5.53), and low oxygen saturation (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.03-4.48). Nagelkerke's R2 was 0.377. The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic indicated no significant difference between the observed and expected values (p = .301).
Conclusions: Liquid stool, diabetes, age, smoking, non-use of diapers, fever, and low oxygen saturation were independently associated with IAD category 2 in critically ill patients with fecal incontinence."

Diapered skin is exposed to friction and excessive hydration, has a higher pH than nondiapered skin, and is repeatedly soiled with feces that contains enzymes with high irritation potential for the skin. The combination of these factors frequently results in skin damage, leading to visible erythematous lesions that can be irritating and painful to the child. Behavioral changes such as increased crying and agitation and changes in eating and sleeping patterns indicate emotional distress. Appropriate skin care can help to prevent the occurrence of DD and to speed up the healing of affected skin. This includes frequent diaper changes and aeration, gentle cleansing, and the use of a barrier cream. Mild to moderate cases usually resolve after a few days of following this routine, but the use of harsh cleaning products can exacerbate DD."

To determine the occurrence and severity of skin damage in nursing home residents with incontinence, a secondary analysis of data collected from a multisite, open-label, quasi-experimental study of cost and efficacy of four regimens for preventing incontinence-associated dermatitis in nursing home residents was performed. Sixteen randomly selected nursing homes from across the US were included in the study. Participating nursing home residents were incontinent of urine and/or feces and free of skin damage. Of the 1,918 persons screened, 51% (n = 981) qualified for prospective surveillance. Perineal skin was assessed over a 6-week period; frequency, type, and severity of skin damage were observed. Skin damage developed after a median of 13 (range 6 to 42) days in 45 out of 981 residents (4.6%), of which 3.4% was determined to be incontinence-associated dermatitis. Some residents (14 out of 45, 31%) had incontinence-associated dermatitis of other skin damage in more than one area. This study is one of the first to report the characteristics of incontinence-associated dermatitis in a large sample of nursing home residents. The sample size and random selection of nursing homes impart generalizability to the findings. Incontinence-associated dermatitis is a risk in nursing home residents, especially those with fecal incontinence. These findings suggest that the rate and severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis are low with close monitoring and use of a defined skin care regimen that includes a pH-balanced cleanser and moisture barrier."

Although most diaper rashes represent a form of contact dermatitis in response to irritants in the diaper environment, other rashes may be the result of an allergen in the diaper. On the basis of clinical examination results for 5 patients and patch testing results for 2 patients, we suspect that the patients demonstrated allergic contact dermatitis in response to the various blue, pink, and green dyes in diapers. Although topically administered corticosteroids are useful in the treatment regimen, the preferred treatment for allergic contact dermatitis in the diaper area is the use of dye-free diapers for allergen avoidance. Patch testing may also be valuable in identifying the allergen, because allergen avoidance is the key to prevention of recurrent disease."

Subjects and setting: Fifty-nine adult patients in critical care with liquid fecal incontinence were recruited from 6 critical care units in a large Midwest healthcare system.
Methods: Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: bowel management system catheter, rectal/nasopharyngeal trumpet, or usual care. Subjects were assessed daily for incontinence-associated dermatitis, pressure ulcer prevalence, and other clinical data. Direct care nurse satisfaction with each method was evaluated by self-administered survey.
Results: Incontinence-associated dermatitis severity and pressure ulcer prevalence did not differ across groups at baseline. Over time, the change in incontinence-associated dermatitis severity score was significantly different across groups (P < .001). There were no significant differences in proportion of patients experiencing pressure ulcers during the study among groups. Clinicians reported significantly greater satisfaction with the bowel management system (P = .007) and rectal trumpet (P = .001) as compared to usual care. In addition, economic and safety benefits were identified with use of internal fecal devices. Specifically, an economic savings of $3100 to $3400 per 29 days of care was identified. Subjects experienced no adverse side effects when internal devices were used.
Conclusion: Results of this randomized controlled trial provide new information for the care of patients with fecal incontinence in the critical care setting. Incontinence-associated dermatitis severity scores differed across groups over time, pressure ulcer prevalence did not differ across groups over time, use of an internal device or bowel management system improved clinician satisfaction, and the use of internal fecal methods was more cost-effective than usual care."

191,191,A Natural Cream-to-Powder Formulation Developed for the Prevention of Diaper Dermatitis in Diaper-Wearing Infants and Children: Barrier Property and In-Use Tolerance Studies,2018,J Drugs Dermatol,Hemali B Gunt,,"Introduction: Diaper dermatitis is a common condition that develops in the diaper area due to factors such as elevated moisture, increased skin surface pH, and exposure to irritants from urine and feces. These factors suggest interventions to prevent or treat diaper dermatitis such as exposing the skin to air, frequent diaper changes, and thorough cleansing of the diaper area. Barrier creams and powders also have a role in preventing and treating diaper dermatitis. We developed a cream-to-powder product with a formula based on corn starch and other natural ingredients for use in the diaper area.
Methods: Dye exclusion study: The barrier properties of the cream-to-powder product were assessed using a dye exclusion protocol. Skin color at treated and untreated forearm sites was measured at baseline and after exposure to crystal violet stain. The cream-to-powder product's ability to inhibit the water-soluble dye from reaching the skin was judged by comparing color changes at the treated and untreated sites. Tolerance-in-use study: The safety of the cream-to-powder product was assessed in a four-week tolerance-in-use study conducted in a group of 52 diaper-wearing infants and toddlers. Subjects' parents/guardians applied the cream-to-powder product at each diaper change. A pediatrician judged safety endpoints of erythema, dryness, and edema in the diaper area at baseline and at study end. Parents/guardians also completed a questionnaire at study end. These studies have complied with Good Clinical Practices (GCP/ICH).
Outcomes: The cream-to-powder product prevented about 70% of the test dye from reaching the skin surface, demonstrating its ability to supplement the skin barrier. The tolerance-in-use study showed no statistically significant changes in any of the safety endpoints; there were no adverse events. Parents/guardians responses to the cream-to-powder product were overwhelmingly positive. Taken together, these results support that the cream-to-powder formulation is safe and effective for helping to prevent diaper dermatitis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(5):566-570."

Design: Prospective, single-group study.
Participants and setting: Thirty women 65 years or older participated in the study. Participants had healthy skin of the buttocks, perineal, and perigenital areas and were not incontinent of urine or stool. The study was conducted at a contracted clinical research facility in Southeastern United States.
Methods: Four hundred milliliters of synthetic urine was distributed across the width of a premium incontinence pad with wicking technology containing a superabsorbent polymer core. Participants laid supine for a total of 4 hours, with the wet pad under the buttocks. Skin assessments were conducted at baseline prior to contact with the wet pad, at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, and 4 hours after exposure to the synthetic urine. Outcome measures were skin moisture content, cutaneous pH, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), mean coefficient of friction values (static and dynamic), and tolerability evaluations (expert clinical grader-assessed erythema and participant-assessed discomfort).
Results: Mean moisture content of the skin increased from 46.19 Â± 22.1 to 1845.28 Â± 542.7 micro-Siemens (Î¼S) after just 15 minutes of exposure and was significantly increased at all time points compared to baseline (P < .001). Cutaneous pH increased from 5.67 Â± 0.5 to 6.25 Â± 0.1 after 15 minutes; pH was higher at all time points compared to baseline (P < .001). Passive transfer of water through the stratum corneum (TEWL) showed an increase from 9.02 Â± 2.2 g/m/h at baseline to 16.83 Â± 5.2 g/m/h at 4 hours (P < .001). There was a significant increase from baseline to 4 hours in mean coefficient of static friction (0.32 Â± 0.01 vs 0.47 Â± 0.03; P < .00001) as well as mean coefficient of dynamic friction (0.29 Â± 0.01 vs 0.42 Â± 0.02; P < .00001). There was a significant increase in erythema and an increase in participant-assessed discomfort at all time points (P < .005).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that impairment of the skin's epithelial-moisture barrier function associated with inflammation and development of incontinence-associated dermatitis begins rapidly after an incontinence event, even with the use of a premium pad with wicking technology. Study findings also suggest that prompt attention to incontinence events is needed to prevent moisture-associated skin damage (incontinence-associated dermatitis) even when absorbent pads are used."

However, the use of diaper poses a risk of developing diaper dermatitis. Recent innovations in diaper technology have led to development of superabsobent disposable diapers, emollient delivering diapers and breathable diapers. These newer types of diapers reduce the incidence of diaper dermatitis. The non-biodegradable material used in superabsorbent diapers is, however, a matter of serious concern because of its toxic effects and environmental pollution. The different type of diapers, recent advances in them and their environmental concerns are discussed in this article."

MASD is characterized by inflammation of the skin, occurring with or without erosion or secondary cutaneous infection. Multiple conditions may result in MASD; 4 of the most common forms are incontinence-associated dermatitis, intertriginous dermatitis, periwound moisture-associated dermatitis, and peristomal moisture-associated dermatitis. Although evidence is lacking, clinical experience suggests that MASD requires more than moisture alone. Instead, skin damage is attributable to multiple factors, including chemical irritants within the moisture source, its pH, mechanical factors such as friction, and associated microorganisms. To prevent MASD, clinicians need to be vigilant both in maintaining optimal skin conditions and in diagnosing and treating minor cases of MASD prior to progression and skin breakdown."

There is also a growing range of skin care products that can be used to prevent incontinence-associated dermatitis and for nurses, deciding which ones to use can be problematic Incontinent patients have a 22% higher risk of developing pressure ulcers - when immobile this risk increases to 30% - and the often indiscriminate use of various lotions, without a significant evidence base, is a growing cause of concern. Maintaining healthy skin for those patients who have a spinal cord injury and also experience urinary and faecal incontinence is a challenge faced by nurses in primary and secondary care. Research undertaken in secondary care demonstrates that standardization to an evidence-based skin care regime, to be used after incontinent episodes, improves patient care in this specialist area."

Method: Descriptive longitudinal study (June 2014-April 2015) in a general ICU. Patients whose stay >48hours and without skin lesions were included. The skin was assessed daily until the appearance of MASD, discharge or a maximum of 14 days. Demographics, stay, MASD type, incontinence, number and consistency of stools, obesity, Braden scale and prevention were recorded.
Results: 145 patients (66.2% male) were studied, median age was 69 (P25=56.5, P75=76) and median length of stay was five days (P25=3, P75=11.25), 29.9% were obese. Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) was detected in 26.2% and intertriginous dermatitis (ITD) in 15.9%. MASD was recorded in 23.8%. The variables causing IAD to develop were faecal incontinence, number of stools, liquid stools, and stay. Those for ITD were obesity and score on the Braden scale. Multivariate analysis selected faecal incontinence (OR=5.4, CI95%: 1.1-26) and the number of stools (OR=1.1, CI95%:1.0-1.2) as independent variables for developing IAD and obesity (OR=2.8, CI95%:1.0-8.2) and Braden (OR=0.8, CI95%:0.7-1.0) for developing ITD. Prevention to 23.8% of obese and 42.9% of incontinent was performed.
Conclusions: There is a high incidence in MASD. Faecal incontinence and higher number of stools are the risk factors for developing IAD. Obesity and a lower score on the Braden scale may affect susceptibility to ITD. Recording of MASD and its prevention in patients at risk is insufficient."

Good management of patients' skin is a fundamental part of nursing care to prevent development of complex and distressing problems, such as pressure ulceration and incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). IAD is skin breakdown related to faecal and/or urinary incontinence, which requires adoption of a structured skin care regimen, including regular skin inspection, cleansing and the use of skin barrier protectants, to proactively protect the skin from irritant bodily fluids. Six case studies using Medi Derma-S skin barrier protectants on patients with IAD highlighted the potential for improved clinical outcomes on skin either vulnerable or compromised due to the effects of incontinence. Positive observations were noted with regard to improvement in skin condition, pain and discomfort, promotion of independence and prevention of deterioration of concurrent pressure damage."

Consequently, it has a significant impact on the quality of life for those affected as well as substantial cost implications. Prevention and intervention is typically through good skin hygiene regimes and regular use of barrier products. In this paper, we describe the development of an in vivo model of IAD in healthy volunteers by occluded application of alkaline synthetic urine to the volar aspect of volunteer's forearms for 6 h per day over a five-day period to reproduce the moist and irritant conditions causative of IAD. Irritation was assessed and quantified on a daily basis by a series of non-invasive biophysical measurements and compared to a contralateral saline-treated (control) site. Dermal irritation was assessed by subjective (visual) and objective measurements (laser Doppler and polarisation spectroscopic imaging, infrared thermography, skin reflectance spectroscopy, transepidermal water loss and skin surface pH). The provocation of reproducible, cumulative skin irritation was successfully demonstrated and quantified. This five-day model of irritation is considered appropriate for the initial clinical assessment of topical products to prevent or treat IAD."

Method: A systematic literature search was performed using available computerised databases for publications on Cavilon barrier film and other relevant terms. Six clinical studies were identified providing data on 1,563 patients treated with the barrier film or a comparator. The publications comprised prospective studies, randomised and non-randomised studies, multicentre trials, single-centre reports and a volunteer study. Due to the nature of the comparators, five studies were open-label. Differences in methodology and outcomes made a qualitative review the most appropriate analysis.
Results: The barrier film was at least as effective as petroleum ointments and more effective than zinc oxide formulations in preventing incontinence-associated dermatitis. The barrier film was also effective in peri-wound skin protection, although its clinical efficacy was not significantly different to that of petroleum ointments and zinc oxide formulations. Nevertheless, the barrier film was more cost-effective than either petroleum ointments or zinc oxide formulations in managing incontinence-associated dermatitis and peri-wound skin protection, largely due to savings in nursing time.
Conclusion: The barrier film is at least as clinically effective and potentially more cost-effective in incontinence-associated dermatitis prophylaxis and peri-wound skin protection than petroleum ointments or zinc oxide formulations, releasing health care resources for alternative use. Further studies are required to quantify the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the barrier film and other barrier formulations in different clinical settings and enhance the quality of the evidence base."

Methods: Quasi-experimental study with pre-post comparison carried out in a general intensive care unit. The intervention consisted of an online training on skin lesions and implementation of a skin care program. In the pre-post intervention period, the skin of the pelvic area was assessed daily until the appearance of a moisture-related lesion or intensive care unit discharge. Demographic and clinical variables, type of moisture lesion and severity were collected. To assess the impact of the intervention the odds ratio (OR) adjusted for the confounding variables was used.
Results: Trained nurses accounted for 87.7%. In each phase 145 patients were studied. The incidence of moisture-associated skin damage in the pre-phase was of 29% and 14.5% in the post phase. The OR adjusted for the confounding variables (ICU length of stay, obesity, faecal incontinence and non-communicative patients) was 0.44 (95%CI:0.23-0.82). The reduction of incontinence-associated dermatitis presented an OR of 0.81 (95%CI:0.30-2.16) and intertriginous dermatitis of 0.39 (95%CI:0.17-0.85).
Conclusions: Online training for nurses and the introduction of structured skin care reduced by half the moisture-associated skin damage, especially intertriginous dermatitis."

Symptoms of IAD include pain, redness, swelling, and, in some cases, secondary infections. IAD is thus a major problem faced in critical nursing care. The incidence of incontinence associated dermatitis averaged 34.72% at the intensive care unit in our hospital from October to December 2013. The factors that we identified as associated with IAD included: (1) Nurses: incorrect nursing care and insufficient IAD-related knowledge among nurses; (2) DEVICES: lack of skin barrier products and the use of diapers with poor air ventilation; (3) Regulations: lack of IAD care standards and lack of auditing oversight; (4) Patient problems: skin edema, incontinence, and medication use.
Purpose: To decrease the incidence of IAD from 34.72% to 22%.
Methods: The authors searched the Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHI, and Nursing Reference Center databases for relevant articles that were published from 2000 to 2014. Fifty studies were identified and four evidence-based references were selected for follow-up assessment. Levels of evidence were at levels 2 and 3. We designed an intervention that: (1) set a high-risk notice to increase awareness; (2) held six in-service training programs; (3) developed nursing standards and designed e-learning education lessons that specifically targeted reducing the incidence of IAD; (4) established a regular audit system.
Result: The incidence of IAD decreased from 34.72% pretest to 19.8% posttest (posttest period: April - October 2014).
Conclusion: This project effectively reduced the incidence of IAD in high-risk patients in our intensive care unit. The authors established evidence-based interventions that significantly improved patient outcomes."

Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Subjects and setting: The sample was drawn from patients hospitalized in the neurology and neurosurgery wards of a large university hospital in Turkey. Thirty bedridden subjects with fecal incontinence and indwelling urinary catheters participated in the study. Subjects were randomly allocated to treatment with a perianal pouch (n = 15) or adult containment brief (n = 15).
Methods: Routine hygiene was completed once daily and repeated whenever the perineal area was found to be soiled.Perineal skin integrity was evaluated daily during skin care. Data were collected using a Patient Identification Form, a Patient Observation Form, and a Perineal Skin Integrity Assessment Form.
Results: The mean number of products used on a daily basis by patients with a perianal pouch was 5.80, as compared to 5.46 by patients with adult incontinence briefs. IAD occurred in 66.7%of patients in the perianal pouch group and in 100% of subjects managed by containment briefs, a statistically significant difference (ÏÂ² = 6.0, P = 0.04). The onset of IAD occurred later in subjects allocated to management with a perianal pouch than inpatients using adult containment briefs (U = 30.500, P = 0.011). IAD involved an average of 1.8 areas among patients managed with a perianal pouch, as compared to 2.3 areas in patients managed with adult containment briefs (P = NS).
Conclusion: Management of bedridden patients with fecal incontinence with a perianal pouch reduced the incidence of IAD and delayed to time to onset when compared to management with adult containment briefs. We recommend use of perianal pouches for prevention of IAD in bedridden patients with fecal incontinence."

The study aim was to determine the impact of two diaper and wipe regimens on newborn infant skin pH and residual enzyme activity after stool cleaning.
Methods: Two diaper and wipe regimens were compared in a randomized, single-blinded crossover study. Regimen A paired an emollient-containing diaper with an acidic, pH-buffered wipe. Regimen B was a non-emollient diaper and wipe with limited buffering capacity. A 3-day washout period preceded each 3-day regimen use period. Skin pH at the perianal/buttocks interface (PBI), genital region, and undiapered chest control were measured at baseline and day 3. Skin swabs were collected for residual enzyme activity after a stool cleaning event.
Results: Diapered skin pH at the PBI was similar to undiapered skin after 3 days of use for Regimen A, while PBI pH for Regimen B was elevated versus control. PBI pH was lower for Regimen A versus Regimen B. After a stool cleaning, PBI skin pH for Regimen A was lower immediately and had lower residual enzyme activity versus Regimen B (P < .05), and the pH-lowering effect was sustained up to 60 minutes.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the use of an emollient-containing diaper with a pH-buffered wipe creates conditions favorable to optimum diapered skin health."

Diaper dermatitis remains prevalent despite studies documenting an understanding of prevention and treatment modalities. Standardizing perineal skin care guidelines could reduce DD.
Purpose: Implement perineal skin care guidelines, while introducing novel diaper wipes, to decrease the incidence of DD by 20% within a 1-year period.
Methods: Our unit reviewed evidence-based literature to develop a standardized perineal care guideline for prevention and treatment, encompassing the use of novel, preservative-free diaper wipes with grapefruit seed extract. The outcome measures were the incidence and duration of DD. Process compliances were monitored. The balancing measure was the rate of fungal skin infection while using preservative-free wipes.
Findings: Between July 2017 and March 2019, 1070 infants were admitted for 1 or more days, with 11% of those being born at less than 30 weeks of gestational age. After guideline implementation in January 2018, the incidence of DD decreased by 16.7%. The incidence of severe cases dropped by 34.9%, with 3.5 days per 100 patient-days shortened duration. Process compliance was achieved. Neonates tolerated the novel wipes without increased fungal skin infection.
Implications for practice: The Perineal Skin Care Guidelines could reduce the rate and duration of DD. Newborn intensive care unit infants tolerated the novel diaper wipes.
Implications for research: Additional research on wipes containing other types of extracts or ingredients."

Design: Cross-sectional, secondary data analysis using data collected from the Landelijke Prevalentiemeting Zorgproblemen (LPZ) project, a multicentre prevalence study including nursing home residents and community care clients (N = 4,842) in the Netherlands in 2017.
Methods: A single binary logistic regression model was designed to identify factors associated with the presence of pressure ulcers. Additionally, a multiple binary logistic regression model including modifiable explanatory factors associated with the presence of pressure ulcers was designed.
Results: Impaired mobility, friction and shear (evaluated using the Braden Scale) are significantly associated with the presence of both sacral and heel category I-IV pressure ulcers. Incontinence-associated dermatitis is significantly associated with category I-IV sacral pressure ulcers.
Conclusion: In pressure ulcer prevention, nursing interventions should focus on frequent repositioning and mobilization while avoiding exposure of the skin to friction and shear. The need to consider incontinence-associated dermatitis, incontinence and moisture as important factors in pressure ulcer risk assessment is confirmed.
Impact: Pressure ulcers occur when skin and tissues are deformed between bony prominences and the support surface in a sitting or lying position. They are the result of a complex interaction between direct causal factors and a wide range of indirect factors. Recognition of these factors influences risk assessment guidance and practice. Knowledge of skin-specific factors at the patient level, modifiable by nursing interventions, enables a better targeted and tailored preventive approach."

Objective: To investigate the relevance of candida sp. and Staphylococcus aureus colonisation in diaper dermatitis and to determine the correlation between the extent of colonisation and the severity of disease.
Methods: Growth of candida sp. and S. aureus in the perianal, inguinal and oral regions was determined by positive/negative and semi-quantitative analysis in an open, multi-centre (n = 3) study. Forty-eight children with healthy skin and 28 with diaper dermatitis were analysed. The severity of diaper dermatitis was assessed using a total symptoms score.
Results: Colonisation by candida sp. was significantly more frequent in children with diaper dermatitis as compared to those with healthy skin (perianal 75 vs. 19%; inguinal 50 vs. 10%; oral 68 vs. 25%, p < 0.0003), whereas colonisation by S. aureus at the 3 swab locations was not different (p > 0.34). There was a highly significant, positive correlation between severity of disease and extent of candida sp. colonisation at all swab locations.
Conclusions: Limited microbial colonisation in diaper dermatitis is of questionable relevance, but extensive colonisation seems to aggravate the symptoms; therefore, we suggest that semi-quantitative evaluation should be preferred to the positive/negative assessment for a differential diagnosis."

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of applying the Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis and its Severity (IADS) instrument to patients with fecal incontinence as a tool to predict PU development. This prospective study enrolled 120 intensive care unit patients with bowel incontinence of Bristol Stool type 5, 6, and 7. Trained nurses evaluated IADS scores and the occurrence of PUs daily for 7 days. Patients with higher IADS scores were significantly more likely to develop a PU (odds ratio = 1Â·22, 95% confidence interval = 1Â·12-1Â·33). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed the area under curve to be 0Â·790, suggesting that higher IADS scores are associated with an increased likelihood of developing a PU (sensitivity 72Â·5%, specificity 71Â·2%, using a cut-off value of 8/9). Our results suggest that the IADS instrument can serve as a tool for predicting the occurrence of PUs in patients with fecal incontinence. Patients with IADS scores that exceed eight points should be classified as being at risk of developing a PU, and placed under intensive care as a proactive measure to prevent PU development."

Comparable to the MDS for pressure ulcers, the MDS-IAD aims to collect epidemiological data and evaluate the quality of care.
Materials and methods: After designing and content/face validation by experts and clinicians, staff nurses assessed 108 residents (75.9% female, 77.8% double incontinent) in a convenience sample of five wards. A second nurse independently assessed fifteen residents to calculate inter-rater agreement (p0) and reliability [Cohen's Kappa (Ä¸)].
Results: The Ä¸-value for 'urinary incontinence' was 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-0.99] and 0.55 (95% CI 0.27-0.82) for 'faecal incontinence'. The p0 for severity categorisation according to the Ghent Global IAD Categorisation Tool (GLOBIAD) was 0.60. IAD was diagnosed in 21.3% of the residents. IAD management mainly involved the application of a leave-on product (66.7%), no-rinse foams (49.1%), toilet paper (47.9%), and water and soap (38.8%).

Despite advances in diaper technology, it is a condition that still occurs regularly in young children. To combat this, barrier preparations can be used to protect the skin by coating the surface of the skin and/or by supplying lipids that can penetrate the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum. In this review, the pathophysiology of IDD is outlined and its prevention and treatment are discussed, with particular reference to the role of emollients."

Cost and economic evaluations are important sources to inform priority setting and ressource allocation decisions in healthcare. The economics of skin conditions in aged populations has not been systematically reviewed so far.
Objectives: The aim of this mapping review was to summarize the economic evidence of selected skin conditions in the aged (65 + years).
Methods: A mapping literature review and evidence summary was conducted. Searches were conducted in data bases Medline and Embase via OVID. Cinahl was searched using EBSCO. References lists of potential eligible studies, reviews, guidelines or other sources were screened for additional literature. For evaluation of methodological quality of full economic analyses the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist was used.
Results: Database searches resulted in 1388 records. A total of 270 articles were read in full-text. Thirty-five publications were finally included in the data analysis reporting 38 economic analyses. Ten cost of illness analyses and 26 cost-effectiveness analyses reporting about pressure ulcers, skin tears, pressure ulcers, incontinence associated dermatitis and intertrigo/contact dermatitis/candidiasis treatment and prevention and onychomycosis testing were identified. Limited evidence indicated that low air loss beds were more cost effective than standard beds for prevention of pressure ulcers. Standardized skin care regimens seem to lower the incidence of pressure ulcers, skin tears and IAD but a cost saving effect was not always observed.
Conclusions: Findings of this mapping review indicate that there is a paucity of high quality evidence regarding the economic impact of age-associated skin conditions and diseases. Substantial heterogeneity in terms of study design, evaluation perspective, time period, and way of cost estimation was identified. Because of the overall low methodological quality clear cut conclusions cannot be drawn. Robust and large scales economic evaluations about skin conditions and disease in aged populations are needed in the future."

The lesions are maculopapular and usually itchy, which could cause bacterial or candida infection, and predispose the infants to penis or vaginal and urinary infection and lead to discomfort, irritability, and restlessness. The drugs which have been so far administered for this disease (topical steroids) cause special complications for the sensitive skin in this area. Magnesium (Mg) is known for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.
Aim: The aim of the present study was to study the effect of the cream containing Mg 2% on treatment of diaper dermatitis and diaper rash in children.
Materials and methods: In this clinical trial study, 64 children aged less than two years old with diaper dermatitis referring Paediatric Ward of Hajar Hospital were randomly assigned to two groups of 32. Group one was treated with the combined cream Mg 2% and Calendula and group two with Calendula cream alone. The duration of recovery was compared between the two groups.
Results: The duration of recovery was significantly lower in the intervention group than the control group (p-value<0.001), but there was no significant difference in the lesions size and diapers' number between the two groups.
Conclusion: Based on the finding of this study, Mg is effective on treatment of diaper dermatitis and could be used for treating diaper dermatitis and other types of dermatitis."

Nurses' attitude is an important determinant to take into account in quality improvement projects. This study aimed to design a psychometrically test the attitude towards the prevention of incontinence-associated dermatitis instrument (APrIAD). A prospective psychometric instrument validation study was performed in a convenience sample of 217 Belgian nurses. Construct validity and reliability (internal consistency, stability) were tested. The exploratory factor analysis demonstrated a model consisting of four factors and 14 items: (a) beliefs about the impact of IAD on patients, (b) beliefs about team responsibility to prevent IAD, (c) beliefs about personal responsibility to prevent IAD, and (d) beliefs about the effectiveness of IAD prevention products and procedures.

Multiple studies have indicated the need for evidence to find the most effective skin care protocol to reduce the incidence and severity of IAD in critically ill patients.
Objective: To compare the incidence and severity of IAD in two groups on a progressive care unit (PCU) using a defined skin care protocol: cleaning with a gentle cleanser and moisturizer, then applying a skin protectant/barrier. The control group received the skin care protocol every 12 hours and the interventional group received the protocol every 6 hours; both groups also received it as needed.
Methods: A 9-month randomized prospective study was conducted on 99 patients (N = 55 in the intervention group and N = 44 in the control group) who were incontinent of urine, stool, or both, or had a fecal diversion device or urinary catheter for more than 2 days.
Results: The dermatitis score in the intervention group on discharge was significantly less (7.1%; P â¤ 0.001) in the moderate IAD group than in the control group (10.9%). The dermatitis score means and P values of each group were compared using a paired t test.
Conclusion: The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.)."

In 'snapshot' clinical studies, skin condition under the diaper was evaluated at a given point in time across a large base of infants. Correlations were sought between diaper dermatitis incidence and severity and a number of factors, including sex, diet, maturity, type of diaper, history of allergy, contact with fecal matter, presence of Candida albicans, and diaper change frequency. Severe diaper rash correlated strongly with the presence of C. albicans, and the frequency of rash correlated with duration of contact with feces and inversely with diaper change frequency. Diaper rash peaked at ages 9-12 months and was lower for breast-fed than for formula-fed infants. Exclusive use of disposable diapers correlated with lower rash levels than when some or all cloth diapers were used. In a longitudinal study, infants were observed daily for 50 days in order to determine the frequency and duration of rash episodes. In this study, the tendency for some infants to be rash-prone was clearly indicated. In a third type of study, over 10,000 infant visits to physicians' offices were used to record skin condition. Results showed a three-to fourfold increase in diaper rash if the child had diarrhea during the previous 48 h."

In the 1990s, a polymeric barrier film called the No Sting Barrier Film (NSBF) was developed as an alternative to petrolatum-based ointments and zinc oxide formulas. To date, few studies have explored the effectiveness of NSBF in protecting skin integrity.
Aims: To map the methods, fields and outcomes used to produce evidence on NSBF effectiveness.
Methods: A scoping review was performed in 2015. A search strategy for identifying relevant studies was designed and performed. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and comparative studies for all types of interventions were included; research conducted in any clinical context was eligible for inclusion. Studies were selected by two reviewers; data extraction and analysis also was performed by two reviewers and disagreements were discussed.
Results: Six studies were included. NSBF's potential as a skin protector was investigated with respect to (a) chronic wounds (pressure ulcers or vascular leg ulcers); (b) urinary or fecal incontinence; and (c) post-mastectomy irradiation. The principal clinical outcomes investigated were, respectively: (a) wound healing, wound exudates and erythema control; (b) incidence of incontinence-associated dermatitis and skin reactions; and (c) intensity of pruritus and skin reactions. Pain and comfort were measured in all clinical applications. The main process outcomes investigated were: (a) ease of application, (b) application and removal time, and (c) costs. Zinc oxide and petroleum formulations were the most common comparison interventions in research on chronic ulcers and incontinence; sorbolene cream and topical corticosteroids were the most frequent comparisons in the context of post-mastectomy irradiation.
Linking evidence to action: NBSF may be used for peri-wound skin protection in patients with chronic wounds, with urinary or fecal incontinence and for women undergoing post-mastectomy irradiation. However, more robust experimental studies are needed in all clinical fields where NBSF is applied."
230,230,Classification of diaper dermatitis: an overview,1987,Pediatrician,J E Rasmussen,,"Several types of diaper dermatitis are discussed: generic diaper dermatitis is most common and involves a simple erythema and mild scaling of the gluteal crease, buttocks, thighs, and lower abdomen. Candidal diaper dermatitis involves clinically significant infection with Candida albicans and presents as a sharply marginated area of erythema with significant involvement of the anterior thighs, genital creases, abdomen, and genitalia. Noduloulcerative diaper dermatitis may develop in a small percentage of patients who have chronic diaper dermatitis, as large, raised erosions with rolled margins. The lesions are most noticeable on the prominent body parts-genitalia, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks. Infantile seborrheic dermatitis involves a distinctive pattern of inflammation that usually begins beneath the diaper as a sharply marginated area of erythema with satellite lesions. Within 1-2 weeks, lesions develop on the scalp, cheeks, arms, legs, and intertriginous parts of the body. Impetigo is common in the diaper area, particularly in the first 6 months of life and during the warmer summer season. The lesions are usually bullous and represent infection by Staphylococcus aureus. Folliculitis appears as small, perifollicular erythematous papules and pustules, usually on the buttocks, thigh and lower abdomen. It is common in the warm summer months and is usually caused by bacteria such as S. aureus. Intertrigo categorizes disease that does not fit into the above categories. Often the patient presents with simple erythema of the folds without pustules or induration. This probably represents irritation and low-grade infection. It is important for the clinician to be aware that many other diseases can have manifestations in the diaper area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In reviewing the pathology and typical presentation for pressure necrosis, IAD, and ITD, four factors provide guidance in differential assessment: location, depth, characteristics, and exposure. Pressure ulcers are full-thickness lesions located over bony prominences or under medical devices. IAD and ITD are superficial lesions that occur in areas exposed to urine and/or stool (IAD) or trapped perspiration (ITD). Undermining and tunneling are common features of pressure ulcers, but never occur with IAD or ITD. Similarly, pressure ulcers frequently present with tissue necrosis, whereas ITD and IAD are commonly associated with maceration of the surrounding skin."

Because both mild chemical burns and diaper dermatitis (diaper rash) can cause skin redness and peeling, it is not surprising that some confusion has arisen regarding the association between these two conditions. However, diapers cannot cause chemical burns because they are made of inert materials. Diaper rash and chemical burns are distinct conditions that require different evaluation and treatment, which is why it is important for pediatricians to help parents understand the difference."

This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a combination of antiseptic and urease inhibitor in inhibiting the decomposition of urea by the urease-producing bacterium Proteus mirabilis. We performed in vitro assays to compare the effects of a combination of antiseptic and urease inhibitor, antiseptic only, urease inhibitor only, and an untreated control with the effects of a urea-containing solution. Cultured P. mirabilis was mixed with urea-containing solution, followed by the addition of antiseptic and/or urease inhibitor. The main outcome used to assess the efficacy of the different treatments was ammonia concentration at 4-hours post-treatment initiation, and multiple comparison analysis was performed using Dunnett's test to compare the results between groups. Ammonia concentrations in samples treated with either antiseptic or urease inhibitor were lower than those in the untreated control, while the combination of antiseptic and urease inhibitor resulted in decreased ammonia concentrations compared with either treatment alone. Therefore, the application of both urease inhibitor and antiseptic is more effective for the inhibition of urea decomposition by urease-producing bacteria. Novel preventive strategies using these reagents may be effective for preventing IAD."

Skin grading for diaper dermatitis was assessed at 4 sites in the diaper area. The new diaper offering was associated with less skin marking and significantly less diaper rash at the genitals and intertriginous regions versus the comparator. These data suggest that the new diaper provided significant improvement in both skin marking and prevalence of diaper rash."

Despite recent attention, its underlying inflammatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study was designed to quantify the release of inflammatory cytokines in a human model of IAD. The left volar forearm of ten healthy volunteers was exposed to synthetic urine and synthetic faeces for 2 h, simulating the effects of urinary and faecal incontinence, respectively, and the subsequent cytokine response compared to that of an untreated control site. Inflammatory cytokines were collected using both the SebutapeÂ® absorption method and dermal microdialysis and quantified using immunoassays. Results from the former demonstrated an upregulation in IL-1Î±, IL-1RA and TNF-Î±. Synthetic urine caused a higher median increase in IL-1Î± from baseline compared to synthetic faeces, whereas synthetic faeces were associated with significantly higher median TNF-Î± levels compared to synthetic urine (p = 0.01). An increase in IL-1Î±/IL-1RA ratio was also observed with significant differences evident following exposure to synthetic urine (p = 0.047). Additionally, microdialysis revealed a time-dependent increase in IL-1Î² and IL-8 following exposure of up to 120 min to synthetic urine and synthetic faeces, respectively. This study demonstrated the suitability of both sampling approaches to recover quantifiable cytokine levels in biofluids for the assessment of skin status following exposure to synthetic fluids associated with incontinence. Findings suggest some differences in the inflammatory mechanisms of IAD, depending on moisture source, and the potential of the cytokines, IL-1Î± and TNF-Î±, as responsive markers of early skin damage caused by incontinence."

Design: Nonrandomized comparison cohort (quasi-experimental) study.
Methods: Sixty-two bedridden patients with FI and indwelling urinary catheters in the ICU of the Shunde Hospital, Southern Medical University, Foshan, China, participated in the study. Thirty-one were assigned to the control group (standard IAD preventive care alone) and 31 to the intervention group (standard IAD preventive care plus application of a 1-piece drainable pouch). Stool consistency was evaluated via the Bristol Stool Scale. Trained nurses assessed the status of IAD using the Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis Intervention Tool. The incidence of IAD and the perianal skin status were investigated over a 7-day period.
Results: Participants in the experimental group had fewer IAD occurrences than participants in the control group (12.9% vs 41.9%, P < .05). Occurrences of IAD in the perianal were also significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (Ï = 7.884, P < .05).

Panelists used a structured process of consensus development to create a conceptual framework of factors associated with IAD. This framework proposes that liquid fecal material, when combined with exposure to urine and stool, and bacterial contaminated urine are etiological factors for development of IAD. The framework also proposes 2 pathophysiological mechanisms and 8 main risk factors for IAD development.

In this expert consensus, the diseases incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), intertriginous dermatitis, including intertrigo, gram-negative bacterial toe web infection and toxic contact dermatitis, including periwound and peristomal dermatitis are presented in a differentiated manner. A common feature of these clinical diseases is a deterioration of skin integrity due to prolonged exposure to body fluids such as urine, stool, sweat or wound exudate with associated physical-irritative and/or chemical irritation. In addition, other comorbidities and cofactors play an important role. The diagnosis of these interdisciplinary and interprofessionally relevant MASD is difficult in everyday clinical practice because there are currently no uniform definitions and many relevant differential diagnoses. Effective strategies for the prevention and therapy of these skin diseases are, for example, continence management, use of efficient, absorbent aids with good retention as well as consistent skin protection and adequate skin care. Another important aspect is the education of patients and relatives about the origin, treatment and prevention of MASD."

Background: Incontinence is a widespread disorder with an important impact on quality of life. One of the most common complications is incontinence-associated dermatitis, resulting from chemical and physical irritation of the skin barrier, triggering inflammation and skin damage. Managing incontinence-associated dermatitis is an important challenge for nurses. Several interventions have been assessed in clinical trials, but heterogeneity in study outcomes complicates the comparability and standardization. To overcome this challenge, the development of a core outcome set, a minimum set of outcomes and measurements to be assessed in clinical research, is needed.
Design: A project team, International Steering Committee and panelists will be involved to guide the development of the core outcome set. The framework of the Harmonizing Outcomes Measures for Eczema roadmap endorsed by Cochrane Skin Group Core Outcomes Set Initiative, is used to inform the project design.
Methods: A systematic literature review, interviews to integrate the patients' perspective and a consensus study with healthcare researchers and providers using the Delphi procedure will be performed. The project was approved by the Ethics review Committee (April 2016).
Discussion: This is the first project that will identify a core outcome set of outcomes and measurements for incontinence-associated dermatitis research. A core outcome set will reduce possible reporting bias, allow results comparisons and statistical pooling across trials and strengthen evidence-based practice and decision-making.
Registration: This project has been registered in the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database and is part of the Cochrane Skin Group Core Outcomes Set Initiative (CSG-COUSIN)."
244,244,Clinical tests with improved disposable diapers,1987,Pediatrician,R L Campbell,,"Etiologic factors in the development of episodic diaper dermatitis include skin wetness and skin damage from fecal enzymes. In addition, when urine and feces mix, the activities of fecal enzymes increase as the pH rises from production of ammonia. An improved disposable diaper has been developed to provide better control of these factors by improved wetness and pH control. The improved diaper contains absorbent gelling materials (AGMs) blended into the diaper's cellulose core. AGMs are nontoxic, cross-linked polyacrylate polymers. They bind water tightly, give pH control by providing a buffering capacity, and in a diaper help to segregate urine and feces, thereby reducing the potential for increases in pH from ammonia production. To assess the effectiveness of this diaper, four 16-week clinical home-use tests were conducted with the AGM disposable versus conventional cellulose core disposable and home-laundered cloth diapers. Rigid group randomized stratification of infant maturity, diet, and initial level of diaper dermatitis provided control of factors other than the diaper that impact on development of diaper dermatitis. Skin wetness as measured by transepidermal water loss immediately after diaper removal, skin pH, and blinded visual evaluation of diaper dermatitis were used as skin condition measures. The use of AGM disposable diapers was associated with significantly reduced skin wetness and closer to normal skin pH as compared with the use of conventional disposable or home-laundered cloth diapers. Considered as an aggregate, the four clinical studies showed that AGM disposable diapers provide a better diaper environment and are associated with significantly lower degrees of diaper dermatitis than conventional disposable and home-laundered cloth diapers."

Statistical correlations between diaper dermatitis and age, presence of atopic dermatitis, and health conditions were found."
246,246,Case report: Diaper dermatitis presenting as pustules,2014,J Drugs Dermatol,Ann T Tucker,,"Diaper dermatitis is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. Its cause can often be determined clinically based on the clinical presentation. Primary diaper dermatitis is associated with irritants and spares the deep skin folds. Secondary diaper dermatitis is most often caused by Candida yeast overgrowth and typically presents as a well-defined area of beefy red erythema covering the diaper area and including the deep folds of skin with hallmark satellite pustules. Other causes include seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, acrodermatitis enteropathica, allergic contact dermatitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and, in the setting of a primarily pustular eruption, bacterial folliculitis. A simple potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH) can confirm the diagnosis of candida diaper dermatitis and guide proper treatment."

A product that could mitigate such symptoms would have a significant impact on cost of care and patients' quality of life. Objective This study compared the clinical efficacy of RD1433 and a comparator product (VaselineÂ®) in preventing and treating experimental IAD skin lesions. Materials and methods For the ""prevention"" part of the study, skin sites in eight human volunteers were treated daily for 5 d with either RD1433 or VaselineÂ® immediately prior to synthetic urine exposure. In the ""treatment"" part, exposure to synthetic urine was substituted for VaselineÂ® or RD1433 application on the first 2 d to promote the development of skin lesions prior to the application of the products from day three. Product efficacy was quantified by visual scoring and an array of biophysical instruments. Results Both RD1433 and VaselineÂ® significantly reduced lesion progression when applied as a prophylactic. When applied as a treatment (following establishment of skin lesions), RD1433 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in several measures of skin function whereas there was no statistically significant improvement following treatment with VaselineÂ®. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that RD1433 may be superior to VaselineÂ® in the prevention and treatment of experimental IAD lesions. Clearly, further work is required to establish the efficacy of RD1433 with patients in a clinical environment."

Although traditionally this has been considered as being a specific problem of continence care, it is a common problem encountered in many different patient groups. As a consequence the umbrella term moisture-associated skin damage (MASD) has been introduced to describe the spectrum of damage that occurs in response to the prolonged exposure of a patient's skin to perspiration, urine, faeces or wound exudate etc. It is generally accepted that MASD consists of four distinct conditions, each having slightly different aetiologies, namely: incontinence-associated dermatitis; intertrigo; peristomal moisture-associated dermatitis; and periwound moisture-associated dermatitis. Careful assessment can help distinguish between the four and enable appropriate prevention and management interventions to be implemented. Whatever causes the excessive moisture, effective interventions should consist of the adoption of a structured skin care regime to cleanse and protect, and methods to keep the skin dry, controlling the source of the excessive moisture and treating any secondary infection."

The diagnosis of DTI begins with a thorough history to account for times of exposure to pressure, such as 'time down' at the scene or time during which the patient was flat and could not respond. Patients with light skin tones present with classic skin discolouration of purple or maroon tissue, a defined border around the area of injury, and often surrounding erythema is evident. Persistent erythema and hyperpigmentation, rather than blanching, should be used to determine pressure injury in dark skin tone patients. Differential diagnosis includes stage 2 pressure ulcers, incontinence-associated dermatitis, skin tears, bruising, haematoma, venous engorgement, arterial insufficiency, necrotising fasciitis and terminal skin ulcers. Many skin problems can also have a purple hue or rapidly developing eschar, and a working knowledge of dermatology is needed."

Most cases are associated with the yeast colonisation of Candida or diaper dermatitis candidiasis (DDC). It is an irritating and inflammatory acute dermatitis in the perineal and perianal areas resulting from the occlusion and irritation caused by diapers. Autoeczematization to a distant focus of dermatophyte infection very rarely presents as DDC.

Methods: The protocol was developed according to the guideline of adaptation. A non-randomized controlled trial was used for testing the effects of the new Incontinence Care Protocol. A total of 120 patients having bowel incontinence with Bristol stool type 5, 6, and 7 and admitted to intensive care units were recruited to this study. The newly developed incontinence care protocol was used with patients in the experimental group and conventional skin care was given to patients in the control group. Outcome variables were incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) severity, pressure ulcer occurrence and severity.
Results: The experimental group had significantly less severe IAD (t=6.69, p<.001), lower occurrence of pressure ulcers (ÏÂ²=7.35, p=.007), and less severity of pressure ulcers (Mann-Whitney=86.00, p=.009) than the control group.
Conclusion: Use of this incontinence care protocol has the effects of preventing pressure ulcers and inhibiting worsening of IAD and pressure ulcers. Therefore, this incontinence care protocol is expected to contribute to managing IAD and pressure ulcers."
255,255,Characterization of diaper dermatitis in the United States,2000,Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med,D B Ward,https://doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.154.9.943,"Background: Diaper dermatitis is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. This study evaluates the frequency of outpatient visits resulting in this diagnosis, specialties of physicians providing services, demographics of patients, and leading agents used in treatment.
Design: Records of 272,841 encounters from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1990-1997) were examined for visits in which diaper dermatitis was diagnosed in children. The likelihood of diagnosis in the general pediatric population was calculated and the leading treatment agents were ranked.
Results: There were approximately 8.2 million visits in which diaper dermatitis was diagnosed. For the pediatric population in the at-risk age range, there was a 1 in 4 likelihood of being diagnosed with the skin disorder. Pediatricians provided 75% of services for the treatment of diaper dermatitis; the demographics of patients were similar to those of comparably aged individuals in the general population. Nystatin was the leading treatment agent prescribed (27% of visits), followed by clotrimazole (16%), a combination product of nystatin and triamcinolone (16%), hydrocortisone (8%), and a combination product of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate (6%).
Conclusions: Visits for diaper dermatitis are frequent, and pediatricians are the physicians most often called on to provide treatment. No portion of the pediatric population is disproportionately diagnosed. The frequent use of potent corticosteroids contained in combination agents is a potential target for improving the management of diaper dermatitis."

This project aimed to evaluate and improve the staff knowledge on IAD and also improve practice in the identification, prevention and treatment of IAD in the ICU.
Methods: A pre/post-audit framework was used to implement the best practice recommendations between August 2013 and March 2014. Nursing staff were surveyed and a chart review was conducted to audit baselines of knowledge and nursing practice regarding IAD. Education and product standardization were used to implement the best practice recommendations and a post-audit was conducted to evaluate changes in knowledge and practice.
Results: Thirty-one (pre-implementation) and 27 (post-implementation) nurses were surveyed to evaluate knowledge on IAD identification, care and documentation practices. No IAD policy or IAD-specific skin assessment tool for use existed in the ICU. After implementation, there was a 40% increase in the ability of the staff to distinguish between IAD and pressure injuries, an increase from 87% to 100% in the use of skin-protectant and an improvement from 25 to 66% in the correct application of skin-protectants. An encouraging 70% of the nurses were using a single standard skin-protectant after implementation as opposed to audit 1, where 100% of the nurses were using multiple products before implementation. There was a 16% increase in the staff surveyed post-audit who said they reported on the perineal skin in patients with IAD. However, IAD documentation in both audit 1 and audit 2, as evidenced by chart review, remained poor.
Conclusion: The project had created an awareness of IAD in the ICU. There was clear knowledge improvement and nursing staff were able to differentiate IAD from pressure injuries. The skin cleansing and protection regime is now more clear and consistent, and a single standardized product is being used to prevent and treat IAD. There was a small improvement in consistently documenting the condition of the perineal skin of patients with IAD; however, it was beyond the scope of this project to develop a policy and implement an IAD-specific skin assessment tool in the ICU, as this would have improved documentation of IAD in the ICU."

Data were collected quarterly over a period of 12 months concurrently with the quarterly Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey (PUPS). The PUPS team comprises 40 RNs; 20 of whom are Skin Care Champions with training in skin care and pressure injury prevention. Patients' skin was assessed from head to toe; in addition to assessing for pressure injuries, a data collection form developed by WOC nurse was also filled out by the PUPS team nurses for patients identified as having MASD. We assessed anatomic location of MASD and treatment in use at the time of assessment. The prevalence of MASD was 4.34% (62 out of 1427 patients), and the prevalence of incontinence-associated dermatitis was 1.54% (22 out of 1427 patients)."

We also compared hospital length of stay in the 2 groups.
Design: Randomized controlled trial using cluster randomization based on inpatient care unit.
Subjects and setting: Four hundred sixty-two patients admitted to 4 medical-surgical study units participated in the study; 252 used reusable underpads (control group) and 210 subjects used disposable underpads (intervention group). The study setting was a 711-bed acute care hospital located in Brooklyn, New York.
Methods: Two units were randomly allocated to use disposable incontinence pads, and the remaining 2 units used standard, reusable incontinence pads. Data for PI and IAD occurrences were collected weekly by specially trained RNs (skin care champions) on the assigned units. A 2-level hierarchical linear model was used to analyze the effects of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes separately from any effects of the unit of randomization.
Results: HAPIs were significantly lower in the disposable underpads group: 5% versus 12% (P = .02). Rates of hospital IAD were not significantly different between the groups (P = .22). Analysis of a secondary outcome, hospital length of stay, was also lower in patients who used disposable underpads (6 days vs 8 days; P = .02).
Conclusions: Findings suggest that use of disposable incontinence pads reduces HAPI but not IAD occurrences. The effect of disposable, absorbent incontinence pads should be considered when initiating a hospital-wide skin and PI prevention and treatment plan."

Up to one third of infants may exhibit clinical symptoms of diaper rash at any time, and more than half of babies between the ages of 4 and 15 months develop diaper rash at least once in a 2-month period. Despite misperceptions that disposable diapers are related to an increase in diaper rash, the incidence of diaper dermatitis is on the decline, largely due to significant improvements in disposable diaper construction and materials. Modern-day disposable diapers are specifically designed to limit exposure to irritants in the diaper area, reduce overhydration, inhibit skin barrier compromise, and help maintain normal skin pH levels and have been thoroughly evaluated for safety and skin compatibility."
263,263,Prospective trial for the clinical efficacy of anogenital skin care with miconazole nitrate-containing soap for diaper candidiasis,2020,J Dermatol,Hidenori Takahashi,https://doi.org/10.1111/1346-8138.15257,"Anogenital skin care for the elderly remains an umbrella term concerning protective and non-interventional regimens, particularly for ordinary diaper users. Our recent investigation has demonstrated the preventive effect of daily anogenital washing with miconazole nitrate-containing soap to the development of diaper candidiasis. We extended this work to cover our hypothesis as to whether the miconazole soap has a therapeutic benefit in genital candidiasis. The study outline includes: (i) the enrollment of 21 bedridden inpatients (84 Â± 9 years; eight men and 13 women) who were diagnosed clinically and mycologically with genital candidiasis, and who had never received topical and/or systemic antifungal agents; (ii) administration of anogenital washing with 0.75% miconazole-containing soap once daily for 4 weeks; and (iii) assessment of clinical symptoms and detection of Candida materials by culture and microscopic examination. As assessed by clinical symptom scoring for incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), the ratio of patients with severe to moderate symptoms dramatically decreased by 2 weeks and 10 of 21 patients became symptom-free at 4 weeks. The IAD clinical severity score was significantly decreased at 4 weeks. Compared with the baseline positivity, both microscopic and cultured Candida-positive rates were significantly decreased at 4 weeks after washing. All culture-detected fungi were Candida albicans. Severe adverse events did not occur in all participants. Individual medical and risk factors had no significant correlation with clinical severity and duration of candidiasis on variance analysis. In conclusion, topical washing with miconazole soap is a safe and reliable non-medical approach for soothing diaper-associated genital candidiasis in bedridden inpatients in whom it is difficult to perform prompt medical examination."
264,264,A Smart Diaper System Using Bluetooth and Smartphones to Automatically Detect Urination and Volume of Voiding: Prospective Observational Pilot Study in an Acute Care Hospital,2021,J Med Internet Res,Jae Ho Cho,https://doi.org/10.2196/29979,"Background: Caregivers of patients who wear conventional diapers are required to check for voiding every hour because prolonged wearing of wet diapers causes health problems including diaper dermatitis and urinary tract infections. However, frequent checking is labor intensive and disturbs patients' and caregivers' sleep. Furthermore, assessing patients' urine output with diapers in an acute care setting is difficult. Recently, a smart diaper system with wetness detection technology was developed to solve these issues.
Objective: We aimed to evaluate the applicability of the smart diaper system for urinary detection, its accuracy in measuring voiding volume, and its effect on incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) occurrence in an acute care hospital.
Methods: This prospective, observational, single-arm pilot study was conducted at a single tertiary hospital. We recruited 35 participants aged â¥50 years who were wearing diapers due to incontinence between August and November 2020. When the smart diaper becomes wet, the smart diaper system notifies the caregiver to change the diaper and measures voiding volume automatically. Caregivers were instructed to record the weight of wet diapers on frequency volume charts (FVCs). We determined the voiding detection rate of the smart diaper system and compared the urine volume as automatically calculated by the smart diaper system with the volume recorded on FVCs. Agreement between the two measurements was estimated using a Bland-Altman plot. We also checked for the occurrence or aggravation of IAD and bed sores.
Results: A total of 30 participants completed the protocol and 390 episodes of urination were recorded. There were 108 records (27.7%) on both the FVCs and the smart diaper system, 258 (66.2%) on the FVCs alone, 18 (4.6%) on the smart diaper system alone, and 6 (1.5%) on the FVCs with sensing device lost. The detection rate of the smart diaper system was 32.8% (126/384). When analyzing records concurrently listed in both the FVCs and the smart diaper system, linear regression showed a strong correlation between the two measurements (R2=0.88, P<.001). The Bland-Altman assessment showed good agreement between the two measurements, with a mean difference of -4.2 mL and 95% limits of agreement of -96.7 mL and 88.3 mL. New occurrence and aggravation of IAD and bed sores were not observed. Bed sores improved in one participant.
Conclusions: The smart diaper system showed acceptable accuracy for measuring urine volume and it could replace conventional FVCs in acute setting hospitals. Furthermore, the smart diaper system has the potential advantage of preventing IAD development and bed sore worsening. However, the detection rate of the smart diaper system was lower than expected. Detection rate polarization among participants was observed, and improvements in the user interface and convenience are needed for older individuals who are unfamiliar with the smart diaper system."

Besides being a source of discomfort to the infant, these skin irritations pose a risk of secondary infections. In this study, we used noninvasive in vivo techniques to define measurable parameters that correlate with diaper dermatitis pathophysiology. In 35 infants (16 with mild or moderate and 19 without diaper dermatitis) we compared skin of diapered areas afflicted with diaper dermatitis to lesion-free diapered sites and to skin outside the diapered area (thigh). Our findings show significantly elevated cutaneous erythema, pH, and hydration, with significantly compromised water barrier function in involved areas compared to nonlesional sites both within and outside the diapered area. Furthermore, skin pH in nonlesional diapered skin for the diaper dermatitis cohort was significantly higher compared to the nondiapered sites. These observations are consistent with the current understanding of pathological skin changes in diaper dermatitis. In this study, we demonstrate that noninvasive methods can document relevant parameters to diaper dermatitis in vivo."

Results: Various forms of olive have long been used to accelerate the healing of various wounds and skin damage such as diabetic foot ulcers, atopic dermatitis, diaper dermatitis, episiotomy wound, and nipple ulcer but there are still no credible documents or articles that provide reliable evidence of topical use.
Conclusion: According to the information obtained from the articles reviewed, olive oil appears to be an effective, safe, and available treatment. This study suggests that olive oil is an alternative remedy to minimize the frequent use of chemical-based treatments. More research may be beneficial to reach certainty in terms of curative properties of olive oil in similar or different injuries in different populations."

An internationally accepted instrument to assess the severity of IAD in adults, with established diagnostic accuracy, agreement and reliability, is needed to support clinical practice and research.
Objectives: To design the Ghent Global IAD Categorization Tool (GLOBIAD) and evaluate its psychometric properties.
Methods: The design was based on expert consultation using a three-round Delphi procedure with 34 experts from 13 countries. The instrument was tested using IAD photographs, which reflected different severity levels, in a sample of 823 healthcare professionals from 30 countries. Measures for diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity), agreement, interrater reliability (multirater Fleiss kappa) and intrarater reliability (Cohen's kappa) were assessed.
Results: The GLOBIAD consists of two categories based on the presence of persistent redness (category 1) and skin loss (category 2), both of which are subdivided based on the presence of clinical signs of infection. The agreement for differentiating between category 1 and category 2 was 0Â·86 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0Â·86-0Â·87], with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 84%. The overall agreement was 0Â·55 (95% CI 0Â·55-0Â·56). The Fleiss kappa for differentiating between category 1 and category 2 was 0Â·65 (95% CI 0Â·65-0Â·65). The overall Fleiss kappa was 0Â·41 (95% CI 0Â·41-0Â·41). The Cohen's kappa for differentiating between category 1 and category 2 was 0Â·76 (95% CI 0Â·75-0Â·77). The overall Cohen's kappa was 0Â·61 (95% CI 0Â·59-0Â·62).
Conclusions: The development of the GLOBIAD is a major step towards a better systematic assessment of IAD in clinical practice and research worldwide. However, further validation is needed."
268,268,Does the presence of bacterial urinary infection contribute to the development of incontinence-associated dermatitis? A scoping review,2021,J Tissue Viability,Sofoklis Koudounas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtv.2021.01.008,"Objective: Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is an inflammatory skin condition caused by the repeated exposure to urine and faeces. It is not common for urinary incontinence only to cause IAD, however patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) are also at increased risk for IAD. This scoping review aimed to provide a summary of the relationship between bacterial urinary infections and IAD.
Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles from January 2007 through February 2020.
Results: Based on eligibility criteria, 13 research studies and review articles were included. Despite the acknowledged role of bacterial infections can play in IAD and the importance of eradicating infections for the prevention of skin breakdown, there have been limited studies that have investigated how uropathogenic bacteria, in combination with urine, lead to skin damage and IAD. The use of urinary catheters also predisposes to UTIs; however, prevalence/incidence rates of IAD in these patients are not clear, as they were considered as continent of urine in the included studies.
Conclusion: Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of how bacteria, in combination with urine, lead to IAD."

This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between skin barrier function in 4-day-old infants and the occurrence of diaper dermatitis during the first month of life. We recruited healthy Japanese infants born at 35 weeks of gestation or more. We measured indicators of skin barrier function, namely skin pH and transepidermal water loss, in 4-day-old infants on four places on the body. Individual characteristics were recorded from the infants' medical charts. The presence of diaper dermatitis was judged using the diaper rash and erythema scoring scale, which was based on daily recording of the infants' skin condition by their parents. The parents also filled out a questionnaire 1 month after birth regarding stool frequency and certain external factors. The association between diaper dermatitis and skin barrier function was assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis. The analysis included 88 infants. The incidence of diaper dermatitis was 25.0%. After adjusting for stool frequency for 1 month we noted that high pH on the inner arm skin in 4-day-old infants increased the risk of diaper dermatitis during the first month of life (adjusted odds ratio 3.35 [95% confidence interval = 1.12, 10.04]). Early neonatal skin pH may predict the risk of diaper dermatitis during the first month of life. Our results may be useful in devising strategies to prevent diaper dermatitis."

Because of exposure to moisture and chemical irritating substances in urine, the perineal skin region is always at risk for development of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of an improved absorbent pad against IAD.
Methods: A cluster randomized controlled design was used to compare the efficacy of two absorbent pads. Female inpatients aged â¥65 years who had IAD and used an absorbent pad or diaper all day were enrolled. Healing rate of IAD and variables of skin barrier function such as skin pH and skin moisture were compared between the usual absorbent pad group (n = 30) and the test absorbent pad group (n = 30).
Results: Thirteen patients (43.3%) from the test absorbent pad group and 4 patients (13.3%) from the usual absorbent pad group recovered completely from IAD. Moreover, the test absorbent pad group healed significantly faster than the usual absorbent pad group (p = 0.009). On the other hand, there were no significant differences between the two groups in skin barrier function.
Conclusion: The test absorbent pad for older adults with urinary incontinence might be more efficacious against IAD than usual absorbent pad.

A total of 54 rats were randomly divided into nine groups: i) Control group; ii) trypsin model group; iii) model + zinc oxide group; iv) model + painless skin protective film group; v) model + silicon dressing group; vi) synthetic urine combined with trypsin model group (joint model group); vii) joint model + zinc oxide group; viii) joint model + painless skin protective film group; and ix) joint model + silicone dressing group. A total of 4 days after applying the zinc oxide, protective film or silicon dressing intervention, IAD scores and pH values in skin tissues were examined. Skin tissues and blood samples were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) and western blot analysis of MHC-II, NF-ÎºB/p65, phosphorylated (p)-NF-ÎºB/p65, STAT1 and p-STAT1 were carried out in skin tissue. Serum IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-2 and TNF-Î± levels were determined using ELISA. The results demonstrated that IAD scores and pH values were both higher in the model groups than the control, which were significantly ameliorated by silicone dressing. The skin tissue structure of IAD rats both in trypsin model group and joint model group was severely damaged, the wounds were not covered by epidermis, and numerous inflammatory cell infiltrations were observed. After treatment, dermatitis was improved. Skin tissue from the trypsin and joint IAD models had higher MHC-II, NF-ÎºB p65, p-NF-ÎºB p65, STAT1 and p-STAT1 expression than controls, which was decreased by protective film and silicon dressing. Zinc oxide reduced NF-ÎºB p65, p-NF-ÎºB p65, STAT1 and p-STAT1 expression. However, no significant differences were observed in NF-ÎºB/p-NF-ÎºB ratio and STAT1/p-STAT1 ratio among groups. Furthermore, serum IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-2 and TNF-Î± levels were significantly elevated in trypsin and joint IAD rats. The upregulation of these cytokines was significantly inhibited after all three treatments. Among the three treatment methods, silicone dressing had the best therapeutic effect. Thus, these findings revealed that zinc oxide, painless skin protective film and silicone dressing could ameliorate the severity of IAD rat models, and that silicone dressing possessed the best therapeutic effect."

If the eruption lasts for more than 3 days or classic erythematous satellite lesions are present, addition of an antifungal agent should help resolve the condition. Recalcitrant or clinically atypical eruptions may signify rarer disorders, such as psoriasis, Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, Leiner's disease, or acrodermatitis enteropathica.

Design: Nonrandomized comparison cohort (quasi-experimental) study.
Subjects and settings: One hundred and two patients (>40 years of age) with a Braden Scale score of 16 or less who were admitted to 2 ICUs at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea, participated in the study.
Instruments: Pressure ulcer development was determined based on 2009 Guidelines from the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel. Incontinence-associated dermatitis was measured using the Incontinence Associated Dermatitis and its Severity (IADS) instrument.
Methods: Fifty-two subjects were assigned to the experimental group (standard PU preventive care routine plus application of the silicone border foam dressing), and 50 subjects were assigned to the control group (standard PU preventive care alone). The number of patients who developed PU in the experimental group was compared with that from the control group using the chi-square test (Ï). The IADS score of the experimental group was measured and compared with those of the control group, using an independent t test. Logistic regression was carried out to analyze the relationship between the IADS score and PU development.
Results: Both the incidence of PU development and IADS scores were significantly lower (Ï = 21.722, P < .001, and t = 2.166, P < .033, respectively) in patients assigned to the experimental group as compared to those in the control group. The incidence of PU development significantly increased as the IADS score increased (odds ratio = 1.900, 95% CI = 1.237-2.917). A logistic regression analysis revealed that PU development was related to IADS score (P = .003) and that the risk of developing a pressure increased 1.9-fold for every 1-point increase in IADS score.
Conclusion: The application of a silicone border foam dressing decreased PU development and reduced the IADS score. Pressure ulcer development was found to be related to IADS score; the incidence of PU development significantly increased as IADS score increased."

278,278,A novel treatment of diaper dermatitis in children and adults,2021,J Cosmet Dermatol,Federica Dall'Oglio,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14091,"Background: Diaper dermatitis (DD) is an acute inflammatory reaction, regardless of the cause, of the diaper-covered area. Topical skin barrier repair cosmetic products are the mainstay treatment to cure and/or prevent DD.
Aims: To assess the efficacy/tolerability of a zinc gluconate-taurine/zinc oxide and panthenol/ glycerin/ Butyrospermum parkii butter barrier cream using clinical evaluation.
Methods: In this prospective, open-label trial, 20 patients (10 infants/10 adults), with mild/moderate DD enrolled at the Dermatology University Clinic of Catania (Italy) were instructed to apply the cream twice daily for 30 days. Degree of erythema was performed clinically by a 5-point severity scale (from 0 = no erythema to 4 = severe erythema), at baseline, at 15 and 30 days. An Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) using a 6-point scale (from -1 = worsening to 4 = complete response/clear) along with product tolerability was also performed at 15 and 30 days. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.
Results: At 15 days, a reduction of clinical erythema assessment (CEA) from baseline was observed (mean from 3.2 Â± 0.8 to 2.5 Â± 0.3; p < 0.06), that although nonsignificant, showed a significant progressive improvement at 30 days (mean from 3.2 Â± 0.8 to 1.1 Â± 0.9; p < 0.0001) without any age differences.
Conclusions: Our preliminary results indicate that the tested barrier cream may represent a promising approach in DD rash. It may be used in mild-to-moderate forms in monotherapy without significant side effects or, where required, in association with pharmacological agents. Its long-term use is likely safe."

The aim of this study was to critically review the methods used to measure water vapour flux density (WVFD) using evaporimetry in order to identify a standardised methodology.
Methods: We used MEDLINE (1980-2008) and hand searching to identify published papers that used evaporimetry to measure WVFD when the skin has been exposed to water/saline/urine. We compared the papers with respect to subjects, sites, methods of hydrating the skin, the conditions of logging, timing and analysing the evaporimetry data.
Results: We identified 10 papers. Methods and techniques for measuring WVFD and analysing data varied considerably between studies and it was not possible to identify a standardised method. The main sources of error and variation are discussed.
Conclusion: Little work has been carried out to establish the optimum methods and techniques needed to minimise variation in measurements of WVFD using evaporimetery. There is a need to develop more robust, standardised methods and to demonstrate their reliability for further work."

Moisture-associated skin damage can be caused by prolonged exposure to perspiration, urine or faeces, wound exudate or stomal output. Prevention and treatment of moisture-associated skin damage involves application of skin protectants, but there is a wide range of these products available to nursing staff, and clinical decision making is hampered by a lack of robust comparative evidence.

Skin care protocols in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting seldom specifically address the needs of this at-risk population, leading to inconsistent skin care management.
Purpose: The goal was to support a decrease in the rate of diaper dermatitis for infants with NAS by designing and implementing an evidence-based skin care protocol.
Methods: A retrospective medical record review was used to examine outcomes of 25 infants preintervention and 8 infants postintervention. The skin care protocol was a bundle of 5 evidence-based interventions: (1) a specific diaper dermatitis assessment tool; (2) frequent diaper changes with superabsorbent diapers; (3) application of petroleum jelly and alcohol-free wipes; (4) infant bathing in pH neutral soap; and (5) application of zinc oxide barrier cream for erythema.
Results: There was an overall 80.5% decrease in diaper dermatitis from pre- to postimplementation (P â¤ .01) as noted when comparing positive cases of diaper dermatitis with negative cases from pre- to postintervention.
Implications for practice: Expanding the skin care protocol to all neonates in the NICU and nursery could aid in maintaining skin integrity and decreasing diaper dermatitis in the NICU. More research is needed following this study for the data to be generalizable to other NICUs. This study offers key takeaways including using a specific diaper dermatitis assessment tool and consistently using the bundle of interventions.Video Abstract Available at:https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx?autoPlay=false&videoId=47."

The six extrinsic environmental factors that have been identified and extensively studied in diaper dermatitis are skin wetness, urine, ammonia, feces, local skin pH and microorganisms. Although the complex interactions of the six factors are still not totally defined, we do know that to prevent perineal skin injury, it is helpful to prevent excessive skin hydration, minimize the interaction of urine and feces, minimize local microorganisms, and maintain skin near its physiologic pH. In general, the six extrinsic factors can be extrapolated and applied to the care of adults. Further research in adult fecal enzymes and pH is still necessary."

Valid assessment instruments are needed for risk assessment and classification of IAD. Aim of the quantitative-descriptive cross-sectional study was to determine the inter-rater reliability of the item scores of the German Incontinence Associated Dermatitis Intervention Tool (IADIT-D) between two independent assessors of nursing home residents (n = 381) in long-term care facilities. The 19 pairs of assessors consisted of registered nurses.
Methods: The data analysis was computed first with the calculation of the total percentage of agreement. Because this value is not randomly adjusted, the calculation of the Kappa-coefficients and AC1-Statistic was done as well.
Results: The total percentage of the inter-rater agreement was 84% (n = 319). In a second step of analysis, the calculation of all items determined high (kappa = .70) and very high agreement (AC1 = .83) levels, respectively. For the risk assessment (kappa = .82; AC1 = .94), the values amounted to very high agreement levels and for the classification (kappa(w) = .70; AC1 = .76) to high agreement levels.
Conclusions: The high to very high agreement values of IADIT-D demonstrate that the items can be regarded as stable in regards to the inter-rater reliability for the use in long-term care facilities. In addition, further validation studies are needed."

This research aimed to translate the attitude towards the prevention of incontinence-associated dermatitis instrument (C-APrIAD) into Chinese and test the reliability and validity among Chinese nurses.
Methods: The C-APrIAD was translated into Chinese using a standard procedure of backward-forward translation and cross-cultural adaption. Totally 170 nurses were recruited through the convenience sampling method from three tertiary hospitals in Tianjin, Shandong, and Heilongjiang province of China. Reliability (internal consistency, stability) and validity (content validity, structure validity, and convergent validity), were assessed. Convergent Validity was evaluated by correlation with the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES).
Results: Of the 170 completed questionnaires, 158 (93%) were suitable for analysis. The item-total correlation coefficients ranged from 0.39 to 0.80. The content validity of C-APrIAD was 0.96. A factor analysis indicated the construct of a 14-item instrument in a four factors solution: (1) beliefs about the impact of IAD on patients, (2) beliefs about team responsibility to prevent IAD, (3) beliefs about personal responsibility to prevent IAD, and (4) beliefs about the effectiveness of IAD prevention products and procedures. The correlation coefficient between the GSES and C-APrIAD was 0.49 (P < 0.01). For the total instrument, the Cronbach's Î± coefficient was 0.87 and the test-retest reliability was 0.99.
Conclusion: The C-APrIAD is reliable and valid. The C-APrIAD may benefit nursing research as well as clinical practice to optimize interventions to improve IAD prevention."

Design: Feasibility study.
Subjects and setting: Twelve female nursing home residents whose incontinence was managed with pads and who had previously been identified as experiencing IAD were recruited, along with 16 nursing home staff (6 RNs and 10 non-RNs) and 10 TVS nurses.
Methods: Weekly high-quality photographs were taken of the skin beneath absorptive pads of nursing home residents for 8 weeks yielding a library of 78 photographs. A subset of 10 representative photographs was chosen. The 16 nursing home staff and 10 TVS nurses were then asked to describe and grade the IAD in the 10 photographs using 3 IAD instruments and simple severity scoring system (SSS) developed for this study. Particular attention was paid to identifying any practical challenges staff encountered in conducting their task.
Results: The TVS nurses were able to use all 3 IAD instruments and the SSS and reported that they could incorporate them into their clinical practice with relative ease. Although the RNs were able to use the 3 instruments adequately with some initial assistance, they generally felt that they were too busy to complete them. By contrast, they reported that they found the SSS simple and quick enough to incorporate into their routine practice. The caregivers had difficulty with the text-based instruments, especially if English was not their first language, and they were only able to use the SSS. The caregivers' SSS scores for a given photograph varied more than TVS nurse scores, but the correlation between the mean TVS scores, which were operationally defined as the gold standard for purposes of this study, and the mean RN and caregiver scores (R = 0.811) were fairly high.
Conclusions: Existing IAD instruments are too time-consuming and linguistically complex for use in routine clinical practice in nursing homes. We found that staff generally found the SSS easy to judge IAD severity based on pictures used in the study. This finding suggests that the SSS could be improved by adding reference photographs of skin illustrating each of the 4 points on the scale. Such an instrument could be designed and validated with an emphasis on integration into current clinical practice pathways."

297,297,Superficial fungal infections in children and adolescents,1999,Nurse Pract Forum,S J Rudy,,"Children with superficial fungal infections are commonly seen in clinical practice. Although tinea capitis and tinea corporis are the most common childhood mycoses, thrush and candida diaper dermatitis also occur frequently in infants. At times, diagnosis can be a challenge, but is made easier with the use of the potassium hydroxide microscopy and fungal cultures. Most childhood superficial fungal infections are adequately treated with topical antifungal medication. These medications are effective and the majority are safe for use in children. Oral antifungal drugs are required for children with tinea capitis, tinea unguium, and those who are immunosuppressed either from disease or therapy. Griseofulvin is the current systemic drug of choice to use in children. Several newer systemic antimycotics are currently being investigated for pediatric use. Terbinafine appears to have the best safety profile and the least risk of drug interactions. Itraconazole and fluconazole are also potential substitutes for griseofulvin in the future. The new agents, fluconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine, have definitely improved the treatment of tinea unguium. Despite the availability of effective medications for treatment of superficial fungal infections, failure to take local and environmental measures to prevent transmission and reinfection will nullify the use of any treatment."

The tool was designed based on the internationally validated Ghent Global IAD Categorisation Tool (GLOBIAD). After designing and validation by experts, one trained researcher carried out 36 observations of 9 patients affected with IAD. Photographs of the IAD lesions were independently assessed by a second trained researcher. Measures for inter-rater agreement (po ) and reliability [Cohen's Kappa (Ä¸) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC)] were analysed. The po ranged between 0.86 for the item 'maceration' and 0.97 for the item 'clinical signs of infection'. The Ä¸ for the item 'GLOBIAD classification' was 0.61 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.95] and 0.72 (95% CI 0.50-0.95) for 'maceration'. The lowest Ä¸ was found for the item 'oedema' (0.27; 95% CI -0.24-0.79). The ICC of the item 'redness' was 0.83 (95% CI 0.69-0.91) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.76-0.93) for 'skin loss'. The inter-rater agreement and reliability of the GLOBIAD-M appears to be good for the assessment of photographs by experts. This tool could support clinical decision-making for IAD treatment. Further validation with clinicians is, however, needed."

This study evaluated a wide range of infant diaper products. Eighty healthy volunteers wore 2-inch wetted diaper patches on their volar forearm for two hours. An evaporimeter was used to measure excess skin wetness attributed to the patches. The amount of moisture retained in the patch was also calculated. We found that superabsorbent (SA) disposable diapers kept the skin drier and retained more synthetic urine than cloth reusable and conventional disposable brands, and thus have the greatest potential for helping prevent diaper dermatitis. The SA brands evaluated did an equally adequate job in keeping the skin dry and in retaining moisture. Conventional disposable diapers were less able to keep the skin dry than SA diapers and were not superior to cloth products in most instances. Cloth diapers' performance depended on their composition. Those with several layers of the same fabric were less successful in keeping the skin dry than ones that contained middle layers of different nonwoven components."

A major cause of skin breakdown is prolonged exposure to moisture, but this is often overlooked. When skin is wet, it becomes more susceptible to damage from friction and shearing forces, and skin flora can penetrate the disrupted barrier, causing further irritation and inflammation. If untreated, moisture-associated skin damage (MASD) can rapidly lead to excoriation and skin breakdown. MASD includes incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), which is caused by prolonged skin exposure to urine and stool, particularly liquid stool. For patients at a high risk of developing IAD, preventive measures should be instituted as soon as possible. The main one is to prevent excessive contact of the skin with moisture. Optimal skin care should be provided to patients with any form of MASD. It should be based on a structured regimen and include the use of a gentle skin cleanser, a barrier product and moisturiser. Derma Protective Plus is a liquid barrier that gives long-lasting protection against chafing or ingress of urine and stool into the skin. This product is less greasy than others, and provides a barrier and a healing environment, with resistance to further maceration from IAD or persistent loose stools."

This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial compared the efficacy and safety of miconazole nitrate 0.25% in a zinc oxide/petrolatum base with that of the ointment base alone in treating acute diaper dermatitis in infants and evaluated the role of Candida albicans in the response to treatment. Infants age 2-13 months with diaper rash were treated with either miconazole nitrate 0.25% (N = 101) or ointment base (N = 101) for 7 days. Although improvement in rash from baseline was seen in both treatment groups on days 3, 5, and 7, patients receiving miconazole nitrate 0.25% had significantly fewer rash sites and lower mean total rash scores on days 5 and 7 (p < 0.001). In the miconazole nitrate 0.25% group, improvement was most marked among those with moderate or severe diaper dermatitis at baseline and among patients whose baseline rashes were positive for C. albicans. Treatment with miconazole nitrate 0.25% was as safe as with ointment base alone. Miconazole nitrate 0.25% ointment is a safe and effective treatment for diaper dermatitis in infants."

Design: A prospective randomized comparative study.
Methods: In vitro. The susceptibility of 20 clinical isolates of Candida albicans to 2% mupirocin, nystatin, and five additional antifungal agents was evaluated using the Nathan agar-well diffusion assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of mupirocin against the Candida species was determined using a tube dilution method. In vivo. Twenty patients (mean age, 12 months; range, 1 month to 4 years) with moderate to severe Monilia diaper dermatitis either had mupirocin ointment or nystatin cream applied to the infected area every 8 h or after every diaper change for a period of 7 days. Microscopic examination of skin scrapings and mycologic and microbiological cultures were performed before treatment and daily for 7 days, and progress was clinically assessed.
Results: In vitro. Topical mupirocin produced a greater zone of inhibition than nystatin cream, i.e. a mean of 27.2 mm (SD 1.55) compared with a mean of 17.3 mm (SD 1.08) for nystatin cream. MIC for mupirocin of 512 microg/mL in one case, 256 microg/mL in six cases, 200 microg/mL in 10 cases and 400 microg/mL in three cases were obtained for the 20 clinical isolates. C. albicans also displayed a universal sensitivity to mupirocin and nystatin. In vivo. Eradication of all Candida organisms was achieved within 2-6 days (mean, 2.6 days) in 10 patients receiving topical mupirocin therapy with rapid healing of the excoriated wounds (mean, 4.7 days). Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were eradicated from the infected area within the trial period. Ten patients received topical nystatin cream and, in each case, Candida was successfully cleared within 5 days (mean, 2.8 days). Only three wounds were clinically healed within the trial period, however. The remaining seven wounds showed evidence of improved, but ongoing excoriated dermatitis and a heavy growth of polymicrobial organisms.
Conclusions: Both agents eradicated Candida, the major difference being the marked response of the diaper dermatitis to mupirocin. Mupirocin should be applied topically 3-4 times daily or with each diaper change and is an excellent antifungal agent."

Methods: A convenience sample of 602 nurses took the pressure ulcer classification system and incontinence-associated dermatitis knowledge test (PUCS & IAD KT) and completed the visual differentiation tool (VDT), consisting of 21 photographs with clinical information.
Results: The overall mean score for correct answers was 14.5 (Â±3.2) in PUCS & IAD KT and 11.15 (Â±4.9) in PUCS & IAD VDT. Incorrect responses were most common for statements related to stage III, IAD for PUCS & IAD KT, and suspected deep tissue injury (SDTI), unstageable, and stage III for PUCS & IAD VDT. Significant correlations were found between PUCS & IAD KT and VDT (r=.48, p<.001). Factors affecting scores for PUCS & IAD VDT were PUCS & IAD KT, frequency of pressure ulcer, IAD management and participation in wound care education programs.
Conclusion: Results indicate that nurses have an overall understanding of PUCS & IAD, but low visual differentiation ability regarding stage III, SDTI, and unstageable ulcers. Continuing education is needed to further improve knowledge and visual differentiation ability for PUCS & IAD."

Eighty-four patients were recruited in a tertiary hospital in Singapore between April 2019 and January 2020 (T1: n = 23; T2: n = 37; Control: n = 24). Although not statistically significant, patients treated with T1 and T2 were 1.5 times as likely to experience IAD healing within seven days compared with the control (P = .66). Healing was more pronounced in participants with skin loss treated with T1 or T2. No treatment was superior in preventing IAD deterioration, the prevalence of which remained small (8%-14%). While skin cleaning and protectants reduced the overall risk of skin deterioration, the addition of skin cleansers enhanced IAD healing within a short period, an important consideration for future research examining IAD treatment in acute care."

Results: The investigational product did not support the growth of all organisms tested for 48 h in these assays. The results demonstrate the barrier properties of this investigational formulation against bacteria and yeast that are relevant to incontinent patients. Innovation: IAD accompanied by skin damage is difficult to manage with currently available products. A new skin protectant that can be applied as a liquid and polymerizes into a breathable film in situ even in the presence of exudate (as shown previously) has been developed and tested to ensure that it does not support microbial growth. Conclusion: This work verifies that this new product does not support microbial growth in vitro using organisms relevant for the intended application."

Many studies have indicated the need for evidence to find the most effective skin care protocol to reduce the incidence and severity of IAD in critically ill patients.
Aim and objective: To develop a need-based interventional skin care protocol on IAD after identifying the risk of developing IAD in critically ill patients and by assessing the nurse's knowledge and practice on IAD.
Materials and methods: Quantitative research approach with an exploratory research design was adopted in the study. A total of 40 staff nurses and 100 patients were included. To assess the knowledge of staff nurses regarding IAD, a knowledge questionnaire was administered and the IAD prevention practice among staff nurses was assessed with the help of an observation checklist. The risk of IAD among 100 critically ill patients was observed by the investigator, using a perineal risk assessment tool. The obtained data were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. The protocol was developed by the researcher and it was validated by 5 experts.
Results: The results revealed that most of patients (60%) had a high risk for development of IAD. Most of the nurses had poor knowledge (40%) and had poor practice in assessment, perineal area, and prevention of infection area. Hence considering all these aspects, a protocol was developed.
Conclusion: The researchers developed a need-based skin care protocol to decrease the development of IAD.

However, no previous study has compared different formulations of wipe. The aim of the BaSICS study was to identify any differences in incidence of irritant diaper dermatitis (IDD) in infants assigned to three different brands of wipe, all marketed as suitable for neonates, but which contained varying numbers of ingredients.
Methods: Women were recruited during the prenatal period. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of three brands of wipe for use during the first eight weeks following childbirth. All participants received the same nappies. Participants reported their infant's skin integrity on a scale of 1-5 daily using a bespoke smartphone application. Analysis of effect of brand on clinically significant IDD (score 3 or more) incidence was conducted using a negative binomial generalised linear model, controlling for possible confounders at baseline. Analysts were blind to brand of wipe.
Results: Of 737 women enrolled, 15 were excluded (admitted to neonatal intensive care, premature or other infant health issues). Of the 722 eligible babies, 698 (97%) remained in the study for the full 8-week duration, 24.6% of whom had IDD at some point during the study. Mothers using the brand with the fewest ingredients reported fewer days of clinically significant nappy rash (scoreâ¥3) than participants using the two other brands (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001). Severe IDD (grades 4 and 5) was rare (2.4%).
Conclusions: Rarity of severe IDD suggested that sensitive formula baby wipes are safe when used in cleansing babies from birth to eight weeks during nappy changes. The brand with fewest ingredients had significantly fewer days of clinically significant IDD. Daily observations recorded on a smartphone application proved to be a highly acceptable method of obtaining real-time data on IDD.
Clinical trial registration: This study was not designed or registered as a clinical trial as no intervention in normal patterns of infant care took place. Mothers who had already decided to use disposable nappies and a baby wipe product agreed to observe and report on their infants' skin condition; in return they received a 9-week supply of free nappies and wipes."

Aims: To determine the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of evidence-based (EB) nursing interventions on increasing tissue tolerance by maintaining tissue integrity.
Methods: The study involved 154 patients in two intensive care units (77 patients, control group; 77 patients, intervention group). Data were collected using the following: patient characteristics form, Braden PU risk assessment scale, tissue integrity monitoring form, PU identification form, IAD and severity scale, and a cost table of the interventions. Patients in the intervention group were cared for by nurses trained in the use of the data collection tools and in EB practices to improve tissue tolerance. Routine nursing care was given to the patients in the control group. The researcher observed all patients in terms of tissue integrity and recorded the care-related costs.
Results: Deterioration of tissue integrity was observed in 18.2% patients in the intervention group compared to 54.5% in the control group (p < .05). The average cost to increase tissue tolerance prevention in the intervention and control groups was XÂ¯ = $204.34 Â± 41.07 and XÂ¯ = $138.90 Â± 1.70, respectively.
Linking evidence to action: It is recommended that EB policies and procedures are developed to improve tissue tolerance by maintaining tissue integrity.
Conclusions: Although the cost of EB preventive initiatives is relatively high compared to those that are not EB, the former provide a significant reduction in the prevalence of tissue integrity deterioration."

No diagnosis of specific etiology was made. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed for Candida albicans, and information on family characteristics, infant diet, general health, history of rash, and diapering habits and practices was collected by questionnaire. The distribution of the severity of observed diaper rash can be described as a logarithmic-normal function, implying several multiplicative causative factors. Within the total severity range, there appear to be three subcategories of diaper rash, differing in some manner, perhaps reflecting different etiologies. The frequency of observed diaper rash was a function of the maturity of the infant, reaching a maximum around 9 to 12 months of age. The prevalence of severe rash correlated with the presence and level of fecal C. albicans. Infants diapered exclusively in disposable diapers showed less rash (P less than 0.001) than those diapered exclusively or sometimes in cloth diapers."

Among the factors associated with greater frequency of DD are high skin pH and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). This study examined the prevalence of DD in healthy black children in Nigeria and evaluated the association between skin surface pH, TEWL, and DD in this population.
Methods: The study was cross-sectional in design and involved children younger than 2 years attending eight immunization clinics in Ibadan, Nigeria (N = 424). Children were recruited into the study using multistage sampling. Information collected included sociodemographic data, diapering and feeding practices. Physical examination of the diaper area was performed on each child to determine whether dermatitis was present. TEWL and skin pH were measured on the anterior chest wall and gluteal areas of each child.
Results: A total of 165 (38.9%) children had clinical evidence of DD. The mean skin pH and TEWL values were higher in the gluteal area than the anterior chest wall in all subjects, with or without dermatitis. The mean skin pH and TEWL were significantly higher on the anterior chest wall and in the gluteal area in children with DD.
Conclusion: In Nigerian children with DD, skin pH and TEWL are higher in the diaper area and at an unaffected skin site."

At 14 weeks of age, we noted that infants in diapers containing absorbent gelling material had significantly less diaper dermatitis than those in conventional disposable diapers. Despite the overall low prevalence of diaper dermatitis in the newborn period, 7 of 204 infants evaluated had small skin erosions in the diaper area noted within the first 4 days of age. Both diaper types were associated with infants with erosions. This surprisingly high incidence of erosions in newborn infants suggests previously undocumented increased skin fragility of full-term infants."

In wound care, silicone is a component of contact layer dressings for superficial wounds and silicone gel sheeting for reducing the risk of scarring, as well as of barriers for incontinence-associated dermatitis. Regarding stoma accessories, silicone is established in barrier films to prevent contact dermatitis, adhesive removers to prevent skin stripping and filler gels to prevent appliance leaks. Until recently, silicone has not been used in stoma appliances flanges, as its hydrophobic nature has not allowed for moisture management to permit transepidermal water loss and prevent maceration. Traditional hydrocolloid appliances manage moisture by absorbing water, but this can lead to saturation and moisture-associated skin damage (MASD), as well as increased adhesion and resultant skin tears on removal, known as medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI). However, novel silicone compounds have been developed with a distinct evaporation-based mechanism of moisture management. This uses colloidal separation to allow the passage of water vapour at a rate equivalent to normal transepidermal water loss. It has been shown to minimise MASD, increase wear time and permit atraumatic removal without the use of adhesive solvents. Trio Healthcare has introduced this technology with a range of silicone-based flange extenders and is working with the University of Bradford Centre for Skin Sciences on prototype silicone-based stoma appliance flanges designed to significantly reduce the incidence of peristomal skin complications, such as MARSI and MASD. It is hoped that this will also increase appliance wear time, reduce costs and improve patient quality of life."

This study was undertaken to compare the effect of topical application of Bentonite and Calendula creams on the improvement of infantile diaper dermatitis.
Methods: This double blind randomized controlled trial was undertaken on 100 patients of infantile diaper dermatitis. The 100 participants were randomly assigned into two groups of 50 each, and were prescribed the coded medicine. The mothers were trained to apply the cream and level of improvement was judged by observing the affected area on the first visit and then after three days of receiving treatment.
Results: The mean age of infants was 6.45Â±5.53 months in Calendula group and 7.35Â±6.28 months in Bentonite group. Overall, 88 per cent of lesions in the Bentonite group started improving in the first six hours while this rate was 54 per cent in Calendula group (P<0.001). The risk ratio for the improvement in the first six hours was 2.99 folds in the Bentonite group. Also, lesions in 86 per cent infants in the Bentonite group and 52 per cent in the Calendula group were completely improved in the first three days after treatment (P<0.001).
Interpretation & conclusions: Our results showed that in comparison with Calendula, Bentonite had faster healing effect and was more effective on the improvement of infantile diaper dermatitis (IRCT ID: IRCT 2012112811593N1)."

One group pre and post-test was used. A convenience sample of 407 nurses, participating in PU classification education programme of continuing education, were enrolled. The education programme was composed of a 50-minute lecture on PU classification and case-studies. The PU Classification system and IAD knowledge test (PUCS-KT) and visual differential diagnostic ability tool (VDDAT), consisting of 21 photographs including clinical information were used. Paired t-test was performed using SPSS/WIN 20.0. The overall mean difference of PUCS-KT (t = -11Â·437, P<0Â·001) and VDDAT (t = -21Â·113, P<0Â·001) was significantly increased after PU classification education. Overall understanding of six PU classification and IAD after education programme was increased, but lacked visual differential diagnostic ability regarding Stage III PU, suspected deep tissue injury (SDTI), and Unstageable. Continuous differentiated education based on clinical practice is needed to improve knowledge and visual differential diagnostic ability for PU classification, and comparison experiment study is required to examine effects of education programmes."

Background: Numerous studies have examined factors that predict risk for pressure ulcer development. Only a few studies identified risk factors associated with pressure ulcer development in hospitalized patients receiving standardized preventive care.
Design: Secondary analyses of data collected in a multicentre randomized controlled trial.
Methods: The sample consisted of 610 consecutive patients at risk for pressure ulcer development (Braden Score <17) receiving standardized preventive care measures. Patient demographic information, data on skin and risk assessment, medical history and diagnosis were collected during 26 months (December 2007-January 2010). Predictive factors were identified using multivariate statistics.
Results: Pressure ulcers in category II-IV were significantly associated with non-blanchable erythema, urogenital disorders and higher body temperature. Predictive factors significantly associated with superficial pressure ulcers were admission to an internal medicine ward, incontinence-associated dermatitis, non-blanchable erythema and a lower Braden score. Superficial sacral pressure ulcers were significantly associated with incontinence-associated dermatitis.
Conclusions: Despite the standardized preventive measures they received, hospitalized patients with non-blanchable erythema, urogenital disorders and a higher body temperature were at increased risk for developing pressure ulcers.
Relevance to clinical practice: Improved identification of at-risk patients can be achieved by taking into account specific predictive factors. Even if preventive measures are in place, continuous assessment and tailoring of interventions is necessary in all patients at risk. Daily skin observation can be used to continuously monitor the effectiveness of the intervention."

Skin problems are highly prevalent in elderly populations. Aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between health, functional and cutaneous variables in aged long-term care residents.
Methods: This observational, cross-sectional, descriptive prevalence study was conducted in a random sample of 10 institutional long-term care facilities in Berlin. In total, n = 223 residents were included. Demographic and functional characteristics, xerosis cutis, incontinence associated dermatitis, pressure ulcers and skin tears were assessed. Stratum corneum hydration, transepidermal water loss, skin surface pH and skin temperature were measured. Data analysis was descriptive and explorative. To explore possible bivariate associations, a correlation matrix was created. The correlation matrix was also used to detect possible collinearity in the subsequent regression analyses.
Results: Mean age (n = 223) was 83.6 years, 67.7% were female. Most residents were affected by xerosis cutis (99.1%; 95% CI: 97.7% - 100.0%). The prevalence of pressure ulcers was 9.0% (95% CI: 5.0% - 13.0%), of incontinence associated dermatitis 35.4% (95% CI: 29.9% - 42.2%) and of skin tears 6.3% (95% CI: 3.2% - 9.5%). Biophysical skin parameters were not associated with overall care dependency, but with age and skin dryness. In general, skin dryness and measured skin barrier parameters were associated between arms and legs indicating similar overall skin characteristics of the residents.
Conclusion: Prevalence of xerosis cutis, pressure ulcers and skin tears were high, indicating the load of these adverse skin conditions in this population. Only few associations of demographic characteristics, skin barrier impairments and the occurrence of dry skin, pressure ulcers, skin tears and incontinence-associated dermatitis have been detected, that might limit the diagnostic value of skin barrier parameters in this population. Overall, the measured skin barrier parameters seem to have limited diagnostic value for the reported skin conditions except xerosis cutis.

The manifestations ranges from diffuse skin eruption without any systemic symptoms to respiratory distress, hepatosplenomegaly, sepsis, and death. We report a neonate who presented with generalized skin eruptions at birth, characterized by erythematous macules and papules. The eruption involved head, face, neck, trunk, and extremities. Candida albicans was demonstrated on direct KOH smear, skin biopsy. The disease implies a congenital intrauterine infection and is different from neonatal candidiasis, which manifests as thrush or diaper dermatitis. The infection is acquired from the maternal genital tract in an ascending fashion. Clinical features, direct smear examination of specimen, and appropriate cultures are useful in differentiating the lesions from other more common dermatoses of the neonatal period. Topical antifungal therapy is sufficient unless systemic candidiasis is present. Prognosis for congenital cutaneous candidiasis is good."

The objective was to determine the prevalence and severity of DD in exclusive users of Chinese cloth diapers. This observational study was conducted during a single home visit to 694 Chinese children who were exclusive users of cloth diapers in five inland cities of China. During each home visit, study nurses documented the presence and severity of DD using a visual dermatological scale and conducted transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and pH measurements. Diaper dermatitis was rare in the buttocks and genital area of the children (<20%) but was common in the perianal and intertriginous regions (50-70%). TEWL and pH were mildly higher in babies with DD than in those without DD in the genital and buttocks area. Diaper dermatitis is common in children who use traditional Chinese cloth diapers, especially in the perianal and intertriginous regions."

A hairless mouse model was used to elucidate the role of urine in this process. The results of this work suggest that an important function of urine in the etiology of diaper dermatitis is to increase the pH of the diaper environment by breaking down urea in the presence of fecal urease. This rise in pH increases the activities of fecal proteases and lipases, which can damage skin. Urine can also increase the permeability of diapered skin to irritants and can directly irritate skin when exposure is prolonged."

No studies have investigated the relationship between perineal and general hygiene practices and SSTIs in this population. This study was conducted to evaluate this relationship.
Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in an urban pediatric emergency department. Subjects were recruited into 3 study groups as follows: gluteal/perineal SSTIs (SSTI), diaper dermatitis (DD), or healthy normal skin (NS). Survey responses were analyzed for significance followed by a clinically oriented staged regression to model predictors of SSTI compared with the NS and DD groups.
Results: There were 100 subjects in the SSTI, 206 in the NS, and 151 in the DD groups. Race was the only demographic characteristic that differed between the groups. After adjustment for race, no day care attendance, history of SSTI, household contact with SSTI history, and higher propensity for diaper rash were associated with SSTI compared with NS. Regression results comparing SSTI to DD revealed no day care attendance, history of SSTI, household contact with SSTI history, less sensitive skin, and less diaper cream use to be predictors of SSTI.
Conclusions: Perineal and general hygiene practices were not significantly different between children with SSTI compared with children with NS or DD. Based on the results of this study, further prospective studies should evaluate diaper hygiene practices that prevent DD and subsequent SSTIs, the preventative role of day care attendance, and effective interventions that minimize the risk of recurrent SSTIs."

Study design and setting: Randomized controlled parallel group trial with 1:1 allocation within the first Delphi round of the Core Outcome Set in the Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis project. Outcomes were rated on a three-point or nine-point Likert scale. Decisions about which outcomes to retain were determined by commonly used consensus criteria (i.e., [combinations of] proportions with restricted ranges, central tendency within a specific range, and decrease in variance).
Results: Fifty-seven participants (group 1 = 28, group 2 = 29) rated 58 outcomes. The use of the nine-point scale resulted in almost twice as many outcomes being rated as ""critical"" compared with the three-point scale (24 vs. 13). Stricter criteria and combining criteria led to less outcomes being identified as ""critical"".
Conclusion: The format of rating scales in Delphi studies for core outcome set development and the definition of the consensus criteria influence outcome selection. The use of the nine-point scale might be recommended to inform the consensus process for a subsequent rating or face-to-face meeting. The three-point scale might be preferred when determining final consensus."

Absorbent gelling materials tightly hold water and provide pH control by a buffering capacity as well as by helping to segregate urine apart from feces. Four clinical studies were conducted with each following a rigid protocol that controlled for variables of diet and age in addition to the diaper material that may influence the development of diaper dermatitis and helped to control for any inherent bias in the study. This allowed for the controlled assessment of skin condition with respect to diaper type. Absorbent gelling material-containing disposable, conventional (100% cellulose core) disposable, and home-laundered cloth diapers were test products. In these studies 1614 infants were initially enrolled with 522 of them assigned to absorbent gelling material disposable, 738 to conventional disposable, and 354 to home-laundered cloth diapers. Objective measurements of skin wetness (transepidermal water loss) and skin pH, as well as double-blind grading of diaper dermatitis, were the measures of skin condition. Absorbent gelling material disposable diapers were associated with significantly reduced skin wetness, closer to normal skin pH, and lower degrees of diaper dermatitis when compared to conventional disposable or home-laundered cloth diapers. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that better control in the diaper area of skin wetness, skin pH, and the prevention of the mixing of urine and feces produces a better diaper environment."

Methods: The study included 113 infants aged 0-24 mo. Data on infants' age, sex, weight, mothers' education, nutrition, diaper change frequency, cleaning methods and prophylactic cream use were recorded. Infants with minimum one time rash, were accepted to have DD.
Results: Seventy six (67.3 %) infants had DD [32 girls (42.1 %), 44 boys (57 %), mean age: 6.5 mo]. Infants with DD had significantly higher age than those without (p 0.001). DD frequency in infants â¥4.5 mo-old was 5.8(2.4-13.7) times more than in infants â¤4.5 mo. Cleaning material types did not affect DD frequency. No significant difference was observed in DD with diaper change of â¤3 times and â¥4 times. Significant difference in DD increase was observed with supplementary food intake vs. without it (p 0.000). DD frequency in infants with supplementary food intake was 6.4 times (2.4-17.1) more than in those without it. Human milk intake was statistically significant in causing less occurrence of DD as shown in univariate model (p < 0.05). Rash incidence was significantly lower with cream use compared to without its use (p < 0.001). DD prevalence was decreased 0.203 (0.087-0.477) times by cream usage.
Conclusions: Age, supplementary food intake and lack of cream use seem to be accountable for DD whereas human milk intake lessened the occurrence of DD. Mothers should be informed on dermatitis care and encouraged for breastfeeding."

Methods: Revisions to the existing instrument included examples of colors of normal and IAD-damaged skin that would be observed on light-, medium-, and dark-toned skin using pixels from patient photographs, additional photographs of IAD manifestations on different skin tones, and training materials. Four certified WOC nurse consultants and 2 WOC nurse clinical experts assessed the face and content validity of the IADS-D instrument. The IADS-D instrument was tested for criterion validity and interrater reliability using photo cases by attendees at the Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses Society 2012 conference.
Results: The IADS-D instrument had good face and content validity. The overall average intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of IADS-D scores for all photo cases of testers (n = 266, 95% female, age 53.0 Â± 7.9 years, mean Â± SD) and those of investigators, experts, and consultants serving as the criterion was 0.90. The overall ICC for interrater reliability between all nurse testers was 0.99 and the ICC for tester skin tone was 0.99.
Conclusion: The IADS-D instrument has excellent validity and interrater reliability among WOC nurses. Its refinement for use with lighter- and darker-toned skin addresses the lack of a much-needed instrument in nursing practice and research. Results support continued development and evaluation of the instrument's use in clinical and research settings."

Several in vitro models are currently available to assess tolerance. In vitro testing using artificial urine allows the protective effects of diaper-region cosmetics to be ascertained. Thus, a new model defined as ""artificial urine in vitro assay"" has been added to our traditional pre-clinical in vitro testing program. IL1-Î± is a highly active and pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine. It plays a key role in inflammation and is the biological mirror of irritation induced by diaper dermatitis. This study determines, on human skin explants, if a cosmetic formula is (1) tolerated equally as well in the presence of artificial urine as in its absence and (2) is able to decrease IL1-Î± production induced by artificial urine or Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate. 31 tests including 17 in-house formulas, 10 bench-markers and 4 combinations of products were performed and data obtained are represented on a simple four-point scale (from practically non protective to very protective). It allows determination of formula-type groups that will have predictable protective properties in subsequent clinical trials and comparison with competitors' products. It is a useful aid in the formulation stage and provides readily-useable data for the cosmetic risk assessment."

Objectives: This study aimed to compare the effects of a traditional medicine product (containing natural henna oil 25%) and hydrocortisone 1% cream on DD in infants.
Patients and methods: In a triple-blind, randomized trial, 82 children aged two years or less were randomly divided into two groups of 41 children each to receive either hydrocortisone ointment or henna medicinal product. Infants were treated 3 times a day for 5 days. The severity of dermatitis was assessed on the first, third, and fifth days using a six-point scale. The study was conducted in 2013 in a children teaching hospital in Qazvin, Iran.
Results: Both groups showed an improvement in the severity of DD (mean DD severity on the first, third and fifth days, respectively, was 3.20, 1.39, and 1.20 in the henna group versus 3.20, 2.05, and 1.90 in the hydrocortisone group; P < 0.001). The henna group showed a better response when compared with the hydrocortisone group: the rate of improvement on the fifth day of treatment was 90.2% (37 of 41 children without erythema) in the former versus 61% (25 of 41 patients) in the latter (P = 0.042). No significant side effects were observed in both the groups.
Conclusions: Henna, a traditional medicine product, can be considered an effective and appropriate treatment for DD in infants and children."

361,361,Topical miconazole nitrate ointment in the treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by candidiasis,2006,Cutis,Mary K Spraker,,"Diaper dermatitis (DD) complicated by candidiasis is a common problem in diaper-wearing infants and children. We report a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating the efficacy and safety of a low concentration of miconazole nitrate in a zinc oxide/petrolatum ointment for the treatment of DD complicated by candidiasis. Patients (N=330) who had DD with a severity score of 3 or higher were enrolled. Those patients with a baseline potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and a baseline culture specimen that both tested positive for Candida were retained for efficacy analysis (n=236). Miconazole nitrate 0.25% ointment or a zinc oxide/petrolatum vehicle control were applied to all clinically affected areas of patients with DD for 7 days at each diaper change and after bathing. A follow-up test-of-cure visit was conducted at day 14. Among the patients completing the study, the overall rate of cure (clinical cure plus microbiologic cure) was 23% for the miconazole nitrate group and 10% for the vehicle control group (P=.005); the rate of clinical cure (complete rash clearance, DD severity score=0 at day 14) was 38% for the miconazole nitrate group and 11% for the vehicle control group (P<.001); and the rate of microbiologic cure (no culture growth of Candida) was 50% for the miconazole nitrate group and 23% for the vehicle control group. The vehicle control resulted in mild improvement at day 3 but little or no subsequent improvement. The discontinuation rate due to clinical failure was substantially lower for the miconazole nitrate group (4%) than the vehicle control group (47%). The mean DD severity index score for the miconazole nitrate group was significantly lower from day 3 through day 14 compared with that of the vehicle control group (P<.001). Adverse events were assessed as either unlikely to be related to study medication or unrelated to study medication. By including only those patients with microbiologically confirmed Candida infection, the study population may not be fully indicative of patients treated for DD in routine clinical practice. Our data show that miconazole nitrate 0.25% ointment was well tolerated and significantly more effective than the zinc oxide/petrolatum vehicle control for treatment of DD complicated by candidiasis."
362,362,The efficacy and safety of sertaconazole cream (2 %) in diaper dermatitis candidiasis,2013,Mycopathologia,Alexandro Bonifaz,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11046-013-9642-3,"Aim: Diaper dermatitis (DD) is an inflammatory irritating condition that is common in infants. Most cases are associated with the yeast colonization of Candida or diaper dermatitis candidiasis (DDC), and therefore, the signs and symptoms improve with antimycotic treatment. Sertaconazole is a broad-spectrum third-generation imidazole derivative that is effective and safe for the treatment for superficial mycoses, such as tineas, candidiasis, and pityriasis versicolor. Our goal was to assess the efficacy and safety of sertaconazole cream (2 %) in DDC.
Materials and methods: Twenty-seven patients with clinical and mycological diagnosis of DDC were enrolled and treated with 2 daily applications for 14 days and were followed-up for 2 further weeks.
Results: Three etiologic agents were isolated: Candida albicans in 88.8 %, Candida parapsilosis in 7.3 %, and Candida glabrata in 3.2 %. There was an average symptom reduction from 7.1 to 3.2 in the middle of treatment and to 1.2 and 0.4 units at the end of treatment and follow-up, respectively. The treatment evaluation at the end of the follow-up period showed a total clinical and mycological cure in 88.8 %, improvement in 3.7 %, and failure in 7.4 %. There was side effect (3.7 %) of skin irritation, but the drug was not discontinued.
Conclusions: Based on its safety and effectiveness, sertaconazole cream may be considered a new alternative for DDC treatment."

Approach: Twelve healthy human volunteers received an application of the new product on one thigh and of the comparator on the other thigh. An infrared camera using ThermaCAMâ¢ software imaged the skin and measured the temperature at the skin surface over time to characterize the thermal cure profile induced by the products on the skin. Results: The new product led to a drop in skin surface temperature (endothermic reaction), whereas the commercial product displayed an exotherm and a slight rise in skin surface temperature. Innovation: Cyanoacrylate-based chemistries come in various formulations, differing in the side chains and additives used. They are liquid monomers that polymerize after application, and this polymerization is accompanied by an exothermic reaction that can be perceived as an unpleasant warming sensation, especially on compromised skin. A new formulation was designed to mitigate this rise in temperature. Conclusion: The new skin protectant may potentially be more comfortable for IAD patients, since it causes a drop in skin surface temperature instead of a rise during the curing process that follows application."

Objectives: To determine the causes of DD in the elderly and to evaluate the efficacy of antifungal treatments in this indication.
Methods: Consecutive patients presenting with DD were included. Clinical evaluation, skin swabs for bacterial and mycological cultures, patch testing and skin biopsy were performed at inclusion. This was followed by 1 month of topical antifungal cream and, if needed, by oral fluconazole for the second month.
Results: Forty-six patients were included (mean age 85 years). Causes of DD were established for 38 patients: 24 had candidiasis (63%), six irritant dermatitis (16%), four eczema (11%) and four psoriasis (11%). After 2 months of treatment, 27 of 37 (73%) patients were cured and five of 37 were improved.
Conclusions: Mycoses and irritant dermatitis are the main causes of DD in the elderly, and emollient skin care and topical antifungal treatment can be considered a first-line therapy for this indication."

Nurses' practice of preventing and treating DD is inconsistent and often not evidence-based. In addition, a 2008 Skin Injury Prevalence Study at our hospital revealed that 24% of inpatients had DD. The authors developed a project to determine a consistent and evidence-based approach to DD prevention and treatment including the availability of products. A complete literature review was conducted in addition to benchmarking with other pediatric hospitals, consultation with topic experts, and evaluation of current nursing practice prior to revising the existing perineal skin care nursing standard. The evidence supports frequent diaper changes, use of super absorbent diapers, and protection of perineal skin with a product containing petrolatum and/or zinc oxide. As supported by the literature, we revised the standard to include improvements in practice as well as product updates for prevention and treatment. Hospital-wide implementation of the revised standard included training ""Skin Care Champions"" to educate staff and support practice improvements. Ongoing education and monitoring by the Skin Care Champions is necessary to further improve the prevention and treatment of DD for our patients."

At least 43 cases with iatrogenic Cushing syndrome from very potent topical steroid usage (Clobetasol) in children and adult have been published over the last 35 years particularly in developing countries. In children group (n = 22), most are infants with diaper dermatitis and two cases who had started topical application at a very early age and died from severe disseminated CMV infection. For the adult group (n = 21), the most common purpose of steroid use was for treatment of Psoriasis. The recovery period of HPA axis suppression was 3.49 Â± 2.92 and 3.84 Â± 2.51 months in children and adult, respectively. We report on an 8-month-old female infant who developed Cushing's syndrome and adrenal insufficiency after diaper dermatitis treatment through the misuse of Clobetasol without doctor's prescription. Physiologic dose of hydrocortisone was prescribed to prevent an adrenal crisis for 3 months and discontinued when HPA axis recovery was confirmed by normal morning cortisol and ACTH levels."

This condition is induced by irritation and maceration, and may be further exacerbated by Candida sp. colonization and infection. A key factor in the pathogenesis is the alteration in both the barrier function and the water-holding capacity of the stratum corneum. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of an unmedicated zinc oxide-petrolatum paste and to observe for possible shielding and restoring effects on the water-holding capacity of the stratum corneum altered by diaper dermatitis. The paste appeared to load the hollow skin microrelief. It was inferred that this effect was responsible for a reticulated shielding effect. Compared with healthy skin and untreated diaper dermatitis, the application of the anhydrous paste resulted in a trend to normalize electrometric properties of skin reflecting the combination of transepidermal water loss and the water-holding capacity of the stratum corneum."

Objective: To assess the relative safety of 0.25% miconazole based on the amount absorbed through the skin of infants with diaper dermatitis after multiple applications.
Methods: Of 24 infants with moderate to severe diaper dermatitis, 19 received 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment and 5 received 2% miconazole nitrate cream for 7 days at each diaper change and after bathing. Blood samples were collected prior to treatment and after 7 days.
Results: In the 0.25% treatment group, blood concentrations of miconazole were nondetectable (< 1 ng/mL) in 83% (15/18) and minimal (3.0 to 3.8 ng/mL) in 17% (3/18). Samples were missing for one patient. For the 5 infants in the 2% treatment group, miconazole concentration was nondetectable in 20% (1/5) and less than 7.4 ng/mL in 4 infants. No adverse events were noted.
Conclusions: Systemic absorption of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment was minimal, demonstrating its safety in the treatment of moderate to severe diaper dermatitis."
372,372,Fox sign in a case of terminal stage pancreatic cancer and suggestions for diagnosis,2021,Forensic Sci Med Pathol,Julian Prangenberg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12024-021-00392-y,"Skin signs in acute pancreatitis are well-known and frequently discussed manifestations accompanied by unfavorable prognoses although they may rarely appear in clinical and forensic medicine. In 2018, the district attorney's office ordered a forensic autopsy for a 74-year-old man with terminal stage pancreatic cancer. The autopsy was ordered based on accusations of the deceased's widow regarding alleged medical malpractice and poor hospital care. The widow filed a grievance about multiple unsuccessful attempts to draw blood from her husband in addition to a diaper dermatitis at the right groin. An autopsy and additional histological examinations were performed. After considering all findings, the diaper dermatitis was eventually assumed to be a Fox sign caused by acute pancreatitis, and the allegations of medical malpractice were refuted. This case led us to identify another case with suspected cutaneous manifestations in pancreatic disease. We performed immunohistochemical staining on those two cases and six control cases to examine whether there was detectable presence of pancreatic lipase and trypsin in the skin discolorations and whether it could be used as a feasible method to verify skin signs associated with pancreatitis. Based on our findings, a minor disseminated lipase and trypsin staining should be considered regular and is therefore not conclusive of a skin sign associated with pancreatitis. Moreover, trypsin does not seem to be as suitable as lipase for this suggested immunohistochemical method. Nevertheless, this method might be a useful addition for determining the origin of skin discoloration and verifying skin signs associated with pancreatitis."

Methods: Data were collected over a 15-month period from 347 patients on four in-patient units (PICU, medical-surgical, oncology, and adolescents) on skin breakdown using the AHCPR staging guidelines and compared to the total score on the Starkid SkinScale in order to determine its ability to predict skin breakdown.
Findings: The inter-rater reliability of the Starkid Skin Scale was r2 = 0.85 with an internal reliablity of 0.71. The sensitivity of the total score was low (17.5%) but highly specific (98.5%). The prevalence of skin breakdown in the acutely hospitalized child was 23%, the majority (77.5%) occurring as erythema of the skin. Buttocks, perineum, and occiput were the most common locations of breakdown. Occiput breakdown was more common in critically ill (PICU) patients while diaper dermatitis was more common in the general medical-surgical population.
Conclusions: The Starkid Skin Scale may be useful to pediatric nurses in assessing which patients require intensive prevention measures. Further research is needed as to which of these specific techniques are effective in the prevention of skin breakdown in children."

The aim of this study was to develop and validate such a scale.
Methods: Scale development was based on experience of DD assessment and clinical and photographic data collected during the early stages of a randomized controlled trial of two DD treatments. The severity score is the sum of scores of four domains: severity of erythema and irritation, area with any DD, papules or pustules, and open skin. Possible scores range from 0 (clear skin) to 6 (extensive DD including intense erythema, papules or pustules, and open skin with damage to the dermis). Assessors used the scale to attribute severity scores using high-definition photographs of infants and babies with DD. Interrater reliability (IRR), internal consistency, and test-retest reliability were considered using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Cronbach's Î±, and Cohen Îº statistics.
Results: IRR was very good between assessors familiar with the scale (ICC = 0.949, p < 0.001) and between assessors unfamiliar with the scale (ICC = 0.850, p < 0.001). Test-retest reliability at 2 weeks was good (Îº = 0.603, p < 0.001). Cronbach's Î± for internal consistency was 0.702. Collation of photographs according to severity score revealed a visible continuum of DD severity, suggesting good construct validity.
Conclusion: The newly developed scale appears to be easy to use, reliable, and effective in detecting increasing or lessening DD severity."

The main objective of this evaluation was to test the efficacy and safety of a skin barrier cream in the management of uncomplicated IAD in elderly patients. Ten incontinent patients with mobility problems that presented with signs of IAD were included in the evaluation. The evaluation took place during a 2-week period. The product's efficacy was objectively evaluated in each patient with high-frequency ultrasound scans taken from the irritated skin compared with an ultrasound scan taken from normal adjacent (control) skin. Data analysis showed a statistical significance in favour of the capacity of the product to help reduce inflammatory signs. Photographic follow-up allowed correlation of ultrasound findings and clinical signs. The product was effective in treating the skin irritation and preventing further skin breakdown. There were no adverse events during the evaluation.

It has been estimated that the incidence of diaper dermatitis is as high as 50% in children receiving chemotherapy. The scientific literature suggests a variety of preventative measures, but only a minority are systematically tested and supported by clinical evidence.
Aim: The purpose of this paper is to adapt and implement a skincare guideline to better prevent diaper dermatitis in the paediatric oncology population.
Methods: The Knowledge to Action process was used to guide the adaptation and implementation of the new guideline. As part of this process, different tools were used to identify and review selected knowledge (Appraisal of Guidelines Research Evaluation instrument), to tailor and adapt knowledge to the local context (ADAPTE process), to implement interventions (Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario toolkit) and to evaluate outcomes (qualitative analysis). The main outcomes measured included implementation of the guideline and nursing practice change.
Results: The guideline was successfully implemented as reported by nurses in focus group sessions and as measured by changes in nursing documentation.
Conclusion: The implementation of the guideline was successful on the account of the interplay of three core elements: The level and nature of the evidence; the context in which the research was placed; the method in which the process was facilitated."

The following clinical case shows the relationship between the use of cloth reusable diapers and the appearance of Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis, a serious and rare complication of diaper dermatitis.
Clinical case: We present the case of a 1-year-11-month-old patient, taken to the Dermatology department due to the presence of a lesion in the gluteal region. The mother reported the onset of the condition four months ago after the presence of semi-liquid stools. Localized dermatosis is observed on both lower limbs, affecting the genital region in the labia majora and the perianal region at the level of the intergluteal folds bilaterally and symmetrically.

The most common type of napkin dermatitis is the irritant contact form, which is frequently complicated by an overinfection with bacteria or Candida albicans.
Methods: In this paper, 25 children (7 males and 18 females), aged between 1 month and 4 years and affected by napkin dermatitis, were treated with a barrier cream containing zinc oxide, vitamin E, panthenol (NoAll Bimbi Pasta Trattante, PSN Rottapharm, Milan, Italy). In 20 patients, a diagnosis of irritant contact diaper dermatitis was made, 3 patients suffered from atopic dermatitis, 1 patient was affected by psoriasis and 1 patient presented to a perianal streptococcal dermatitis. A candidal overinfection was diagnosed in 12 patients and was treated with a topical antifungal agent, applied twice daily for 2 weeks. NoAll Bimbi Pasta Trattante was applied at every diaper change. In all cases, we considered 2 subjective symptoms (burning and itching), and 3 objective parameters (erythema, oedema, exudation/vesiculation), at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment.
Results: One patient withdrew the study. In 13 patients clinical healing was observed, 9 patients showed marked improvement, in 2 patients we did not observe improvement. Tolerability was considered excellent in 13 patients, good in 9 and sufficient in 2.
Conclusions: The results obtained demonstrated that NoAll Bimbi Pasta Trattante, applied at every change of the napkin, is very effective and well tolerated in the treatment of irritant diaper dermatitis. Moreover, NoAll Bimbi Pasta Trattante, applied in association with other pharmacological treatments, may accelerate healing in case of overinfection due to Candida albicans and in case of inflammatory dermatoses localized in the gluteo-perineal area."

Among these treatments, the aqueous solution of eosin 2% is extensively used in several European countries, but not in the USA or Israel.
Objective: To assess the therapeutic efficacy of eosin 2% solution compared to the other treatment modalities for diaper dermatitis.
Methods: Fifty-four infants with diaper dermatitis, recruited from hospital wards and community clinics, were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: zinc oxide paste (containing allantoin 0.5%, cod liver oil 17% and zinc oxide 47epercnt;); clobetasone butyrate 0.05%, and aqueous solution of eosin 2%. The severity of the disorder was graded on a 6-point scale by observation and quantitative measurement of the lesions. The groups were compared for rates and time to heal. Due to the red color of eosin, a double-blind controlled study was impossible.
Results: Following 5 days of treatment, the rate of complete healing in the group treated with eosin (61%) was significantly higher (p = 0.0479) than that in the zinc oxide paste and corticosteroid groups (22 and 33%, respectively). Furthermore, in cases of partial healing, the degree of improvement was higher in the eosin group than the other two (p = 0.0205). The fastest improvement was observed in the group treated with corticosteroid cream.
Conclusion: Considering the potential hazards of topical corticosteroids and the greater overall efficacy of eosin 2% solution, we suggest that eosin is the preferred treatment for diaper dermatitis."

Persons with this diathesis are more susceptible to irritants and to superficial infections. Little is known about diaper rash and diapering materials in AD. In this study we set firm criteria to identify a large group of infants with AD for comparison with a nonatopic, normal control group in terms of severity of diaper dermatitis; relationship of diaper dermatitis to diaper materials; and influence of modifying factors (bacterial and candidal colonization/infection, diarrhea, antibiotics, other illnesses, food allergy or intolerance). Babies with eczema were recruited and, from a group of 2,443 respondents, 87 satisfied carefully defined criteria for atopic dermatitis. A similarly sized (90) control group matched for age, sex, and weight was selected for absence of features of atopy or familial atopic history. Infants were assigned into balanced subgroups wearing cloth diapers, conventional cellulose diapers, or diapers containing cellulose and absorbent gelling material (AGM). Assessment of grading for atopic parameters showed statistically significant differences between the AD and normal groups at every visit. Mean diaper rash grades, as assessed by the same physicians at each visit, were significantly higher in the AD group wearing cloth diapers compared with those in AGM subgroups at five of eight visits. There was significant correlation between AD severity and diaper rash scores overall and in the AD cloth group, but not in other subgroups. Quantitative total bacterial plate counts were significantly lower in AGM than cloth diaper areas on three of eight sampling periods in the AD group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In this study, we compared the frequency of mucocutaneous disorders in children with Down's syndrome with normal children.
Methods: We recruited fifty children with Down's syndrome and 50 healthy children as a control in our study. Mucocutaneous abnormalities were examined in both groups.
Fundings: Of 50 patients, 22 were girls and 28 were boys. The skin findings such as xerosis and Mongolian spots were the most frequently seen in the patients with Down's syndrome. Seborrheic dermatitis, cheilitis and fissured tongue were seen frequently, as well. The rare findings were plantar hyperkeratosis, alopecia areata, geographic tongue, cafÃ©-au-lait macula, livedo reticularis, cutaneous infections, pityriasis capitis simplex, cutis marmorata, neurotic excoriation, trichotillomania, keratosis pilaris and diaper dermatitis. No mucocutaneous finding was seen in 16 patients. The prevalence of the skin disorders including Mongolian spot, seborrheic dermatitis, cheilitis, fissured tongue was significantly higher in patients with Down syndrome than normal individuals (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Therefore, large-scaled epidemiological studies covering the entire population are needed. We believe that these studies could provide better understanding the dermatological diseases in children with Down's syndrome that would help to practitioners to treat these problems."

With these features, many leading products maintain their dryness performance overnight. Considering the importance of holding liquid away from the skin, ongoing research in diaper construction focuses on strategies to increase the effectiveness to capture liquid and help avoid rewetting of infant skin. The layout and design of a disposable diaper allows for distribution of absorbency features where they can provide the optimal benefit. Clinical evidence indicates materials can keep moisture away from the skin in the diapered area, helping maintain proper skin hydration, minimizing irritation, and contributing to reduced rates of diaper rash."

The objective of the present randomized and double-blind trial was to compare the therapeutic efficacies of aloe vera cream and Calendula officinalis ointment on the frequency and severity of DD in children.
Methods: Sixty-six infants with DD (aged < 3 years) were randomized to receive either aloe cream (n = 32) or Calendula ointment (n = 34). Infants were treated with these drugs 3 times a day for 10 days. The severity of dermatitis was graded at baseline as well as at the end of trial using a 5-point scale. The adverse effects of study medications were assessed during the trial.
Results: Although improvement in the severity of DD was observed in both treatment groups (P < 0.001), patients receiving Calendula ointment had significantly fewer rash sites compared to aloe group (P = 0.001). No adverse effect was reported from either of the medications.
Discussion: The evidence from this study suggests that topical aloe and in particular Calendula could serve as safe and effective treatment for the treatment of diaper dermatitis in infants."

We devised a strategy to decrease the utilization of indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs). We also highlight the challenges of managing critically ill patients without IUCs and demonstrate some of the initiatives that we undertook to overcome these challenges.
Methods: A retrospective observational outcomes review was performed in an adult medical intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2012 and December 2016. This period included a baseline and series of intervals, whereby different aspects of the strategies were implemented. IUC utilization ratio and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rates were calculated.
Results: Our IUC utilization ratio had a statistically significant decrease from 0.92 (baseline) to 0.28 (after 3 interventions) (P < .0001). Similarly, CAUTI rates had a statistically significant decrease from 5.47 (baseline) to 1.08 (after 3 intervention) (P = .0134). These rates sustained a statistically significant difference over the 2-year follow-up period from the last intervention. Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) was identified as a potential complication of not using an IUC. There was no statistically significant change in the IAD rates during 2013-2016.
Conclusions: Our interventions demonstrated that aggressive and comprehensive IUC restriction protocol and provider training can lead to a successful decrease in IUC use, leading to a lower IUC utilization ratio and CAUTI rate in a large complex academic ICU setting."

Fifteen consecutive patients, 13 males and 2 females, median age 45 years (range: 28-70), who presented with anal fissure (5 patients) or first- to third-degree hemorrhoids (4 with first degree, 4 with second degree, and 2 with third degree), were treated with a 12-h application of a natural mixture containing honey, olive oil, and beeswax in ratio of 1:1:1(v/v/v). Bleeding, itching, edema, and erythema were measured using a scoring method: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = very severe. The pain score was checked using a visual analog scale (minimum = 0, maximum = 10). Efficacy of treatment was assessed by comparing the symptoms' score before and after treatment; at weekly intervals for a maximum of 4 weeks. The patients were observed for evidence of any adverse effect such as appearance of new signs and symptoms, or worsening of the existing symptoms. The honey mixture significantly reduced bleeding and relieved itching in patients with hemorrhoids. Patients with anal fissure showed significant reduction in pain, bleeding, and itching after the treatment. No side effect was reported with use of the mixture. We conclude that a mixture of honey, olive oil, and beeswax is safe and clinically effective in the treatment of hemorrhoids and anal fissure, which paves the way for further randomized double blind studies."

In this study, friction was measured between the dry volar forearm of 19 women (20-95 years) and five nonwovens typical of those in commercial disposable products. Euler's model/Amontons' law held to high precision for all person-fabric pairs for both static and dynamic friction, despite substantial variations in forearm size, soft tissue compliance and skin smoothness between subjects, sometimes substantial lateral contraction in fabric strips, and skin rucking beneath them. For a given subject, the highest coefficients of friction among the fabrics exceeded the lowest by â¼30% to 75%, while - for a given fabric - the highest coefficients of friction among the subjects exceeded the lowest by â¼55% to 85%. The order of coefficient of friction values across fabrics was similar for each subject, and across subjects for each fabric. There was no systematic variation with subject age. The data were well modelled by estimating the coefficients of friction for a given person-fabric combination as the product of the mean coefficient of friction across all fabrics for that person, and the mean coefficient of friction across all persons for that fabric, normalised to the mean coefficient of friction across all person-fabric combinations. Predicted values were within 10% of measured figures for â¼97% of person-fabric combinations. Stick-and-slip behaviour was observed with seven person-fabric combinations, but especially strongly for two subjects with each of two fabrics. It is not clear why and further investigation is merited. Comparison of the data with results from earlier work with the same fabrics and a skin surrogate (Lorica Soft) suggests that measurements with Lorica Soft may be helpful to screen, evaluate and compare candidate materials preparatory to human studies."

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of dexpanthenol and zinc oxide ointment with ointment base in the treatment of irritant diaper dermatitis from acute diarrhea in children by measuring transepidermal water loss (TEWL).
Material and method: Forty-six children with diarrhea were prospectively, block randomized, investigator-blinded to receive dexpanthenol and zinc oxide ointment on one side and ointment base on the other side. TEWL was measured before and on days 1, 3, and 7 of treatment together with the assessment of severity score. The efficacy of treatment was defined by complete clearance of the lesion.
Results: TEWL in the treated and control side was not different before the application of the topical medication. In the present study, the efficacy of 5% dexpanthenol and zinc oxide ointment on D3 was 39% (18from 46 patients) compared to 32% in the ointment base side. On D7, the efficacy of the treated side was 58.7% and the ointment base side was 56%. The patients who still had skin lesions were those who had prolonged diarrhea. On the treated side, the mean of TEWL was lower than the control side on DI (p = 0.18) and had significant improvement on D3 (p = 0. 002). At the end of the present study, TEWL on the treated side was less than TEWL of the control side but it did not have statistical significance (p = 0.07). There was no rash or sign of abnormality on the treated side at the end of D7.
Conclusion: In the treatment of lDD from acute diarrhea, 5% dexpanthenol and zinc oxide ointment significantly decreased TEWL in the treated side more than the ointment base on day 3 but the severity score was not significantly different on days 1, 3 and 7."

To confirm the onset and disappearance of candidiasis, we microscopically evaluated the existence of the pseudohyphae and/or blastoconidia of Candida spp. We enrolled 75 elderly patients who wore diapers all day in the hospital or nursing home. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either miconazole soap or miconazole-free placebo soap, and 28 patients in the miconazole group and 27 patients in the placebo group were followed for 4 weeks. Although washing with miconazole soap did not affect the frequency of pseudohyphae/blastoconidia-positive patients, it significantly inhibited the positive conversion of pseudohyphae/blastoconidia compared with the placebo group. As a result, the frequency of patients positive for pseudohyphae/blastoconidia was significantly lower in the miconazole group than in the control group at 4 weeks (17.9% vs 44.4%).

Washing with miconazole soap was a significant independent factor for reducing the cases positive for pseudohyphae/blastoconidia, while diarrhea and heart failure were significant factors associated with an increase in the positive rate at the end-point. Severe adverse effects were not found in any patients. Thus, washing with miconazole soap is well-tolerated and can inhibit the positive conversion of Candida in patients wearing diapers. Therefore, maintenance of genital hygiene using this soap may prophylactically decrease the overall prevalence of patients with diaper candidiasis."

A model for the cyclic nature of this disease has been developed which incorporates various roles these factors play as they interact to produce skin with compromised physical properties, and further damage it to produce diaper dermatitis. Resolution occurs naturally or through caretaker intervention, resulting in mean episodic durations of 2-3 days. The model predicts that preventing excessive skin hydration, maintaining skin near its normal physiologic pH, and minimizing interaction of urine and feces (which increases pH and fecal enzyme activity) will result in decreased incidence and severity of diaper dermatitis."

The objective measures of skin health seemed to be a promising advance on earlier, subjective methods, and their further development is recommended. There was some indication that the normal skin of an incontinent patient does not deteriorate when managed with Sudocrem or zinc cream."

This prospective, multicenter, open-label, long-term, phase IV study investigated the potential resistance of Candida spp. to repeated topical use of 0.25% miconazole nitrate in infants age 15 months and younger with moderate to severe DDCC. For initial and recurring episodes of DDCC over the 2-year study period, subjects were treated with a 7-day course of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment (active components: miconazole nitrate 0.25%, zinc oxide 15%, and white petrolatum 81.35%) with a 7-day follow-up. Clinical and mycologic evaluations were conducted before treatment (day 0) and 7 days after treatment (day 14). Potential resistance to miconazole was defined using an arbitrary breakpoint of minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 Î¼g/mL. There was no evidence of resistance to miconazole in Candida spp. after single or repeated treatment courses of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment. For the initial episode of DDCC, 83 of 168 subjects (49.4%) achieved a clinical cure, 77 (45.8%) achieved a mycologic cure, and 49 (29.2%) achieved an overall cure (clinical and mycologic). The overall cure rate for recurrent episodes of DDCC was similar to or numerically greater than rates observed for the initial episode. Treatment of DDCC with 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment was effective and generally well tolerated. No evidence of the development of resistance to miconazole in Candida spp. was observed."

Methods: A web-based secure survey invite was emailed to the medical directors of tertiary NICUs. The survey included questions on various aspects of skincare practices in the first 2 weeks of life in extremely premature infants (born before 28 weeks gestation). The person most familiar with local skincare practices was asked to complete the survey and only one response per unit was requested. We performed a descriptive analysis.
Results: We received responses from 30 out of 32 NICUs (response rate 93%). Twenty-five NICUs (89%) reported offering resuscitation and intensive care to infants born at â¥23 weeks gestation. All NICUs reported occurrences of skin breakdown, including medical adhesive-related skin injury (30%), abrasion/friction-associated skin injury (46%), perineal skin breakdown (55%), pressure site injury (47%) and diaper dermatitis (60%). A high level of consensus (â¥75%) was observed for certain practices, such as the use of polyethylene occlusive plastic wraps at birth and aqueous chlorhexidine solution for sterile procedures, but a low level of consensus (<25%) was observed for many other practices, including the skin risk assessment tool used.
Conclusions: Skin injuries in extremely premature infants are common and skincare practices vary considerably amongst NICUs. Clinical practice improvement projects and further clinical research will help improve consistency amongst NICUs. Further research is needed to assist the development of evidence-based guidelines and benchmarking for skincare practices in these vulnerable infants."

The following evaluates the use of this combination based upon a survey of 106 US-based pediatricians with at least two years post-residency, who attended the 1999 American Academy of Pediatrics. Of pediatricians who prescribe C-BMV, 23% prescribe it for diaper dermatitis. 11% of C-BMV prescriptions exceed the recommended duration of therapy. Only 18% of prescribing pediatricians correctly identify ""Lotrisone"" as a high potency steroid. There is no significant association between knowledge of C-BMV potency and frequency of use (p>.1). These self-reported data confirm and complement the findings of previous studies that used representative national data to assess the use of C-BMV. Pediatricians continue to utilize C-BMV in inappropriate settings, such as diaper dermatitis, regardless of their knowledge of the agent's potency. Our advice is to refrain from using high-potency steroids, such as C-BMV, in pediatric cases as there are more appropriate, safer alternatives with many fewer side effects."

While its etiology is complex, there is agreement that prolonged contact between wet diapers and the skin leading to excessive hydration of the stratum corneum and reduced barrier function is a primary factor. Recent research also indicates that pH elevation resulting from ammonia production increases the probability of skin damage due to fecal enzyme activity. New diapers containing absorbent polymers blended with cellulose fluff in the absorbent core have been developed. The absorbent polymer binds fluids and controls pH in the diaper environment. To assess the effectiveness of these diapers, a clinical study was conducted with approximately 150 infants over 15 weeks, using fluff diapers and absorbent polymer diapers. The results clearly showed that the diapers with absorbent polymer provide a better skin environment than those with fluff only with respect to lower skin wetness and pH control (instrumental measurements).

In the control group from conventional deliveries, estimation by Apgar score was similar, but the body mass equal or higher than 3500 grams was seen only in 19.7% and the majority--80.3% was composed of babies with lower birth weight (2500 g-3499 g). The clinical condition of all the newborns delivered in water was good; they were healthy and only one baby suffered from inborn pneumonia, and another one from diaper dermatitis. There were no perinatal traumas in analysed babies.
Conclusion: Taking into consideration such parameters as high Apgar score estimation, good clinical condition and absence of traumas, water delivery is to be judged as the advantageous one for newborns."

We present a 4-year-old girl who presented at birth with cloacal atresia corrected surgically and resulting in chronic incontinence requiring full-time diapers. She presented with crops of herpetiform vesicles and bullae on a base that ranged from normal skin to severe erythema and oedema. A histological examination revealed a well-demarcated lesion showing a thickened epidermis with hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, acanthosis and an abrupt transition to pallor of the upper half. Focal full thickness epidermis necrosis and small areas of spongiosis, acantholysis and apoptotic keratinocytes were seen. Immunofluorescence was negative. The lesions improved with the treatment of secondary infection and minimal topical therapy with an emollient only. This case represents an unusual vesicular variant of pseudoverrucous papules and nodules, which has been reported only once previously."

This study aimed to present the demographic and clinical features of babies with DD.
Methods: Data, including demographic and clinical features, obtained from DD patient forms were retrospectively analyzed.
Results: The study included 63 babies with DD (female: n = 35 [55.6%]; male: n = 28 [44.4%]; mean age 11.6 mos). Most of the patients (43.5%) were 0 to 6 months of age. In all, 76.3% were breastfed, of whom 31.7% were exclusively breastfed. The number of previous episodes of DD was significantly lower in breastfed babies. The most common diaper area cleansing method was wet wipes (54.1%). Diaper creams were used in 86.2% of patients. DD was severe in 22.2% of patients, moderate in 57.4%, and mild in 20.4%. Candida infection was noted in 77.4% of patients. The median number of previous episodes of DD was significantly higher in patients with Candida infection than in those without (p = 0.02). Treatment yielded greater than 50% improvement (complete and moderate response) in 59.4% of patients at the first follow-up visit (3-5 days) and 82.6% at the second follow-up visit (10 days).
Conclusion: Most babies with DD were 0 to 6 months of age. Breastfed babies had fewer previous episodes of DD, so mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their babies to reduce the incidence of DD. Candida infection was common; clinicians should be aware of its association with DD."

The product under study was a soft, premoistened washcloth, including a 3% dimethicone formula, with cleansing, moisturizing, and barrier protection properties.
Design: Randomized, controlled clinical trial.
Subjects and setting: The study sample comprised a random sample of 11 nursing home wards (6 experimental and 5 control) in a convenience sample of 4 nursing homes in Belgium. The sample included nursing home residents at risk for and/or affected by IAD defined as incontinent of urine, feces, urine/feces, and/or having erythema of the perineal skin (not caused by pressure/shear), and/or having an edematous skin in the genital area.
Methods: Participants in the experimental group were treated according to a standardized protocol, including the use of a 3-in-1 perineal care washcloth impregnated with a 3% dimethicone skin protectant. Participants in the control group received perineal skin care with water and pH neutral soap, the standard of care in Belgian nursing homes. The study period was 120 days. Data were collected between February and May 2010. Incontinence-associated dermatitis prevalence and severity were assessed using the IAD Skin Condition Assessment Tool. The surface (cm), redness, and depth of the perineal lesion were assessed daily by the nurses. This tool generates a cumulative severity score (maximum score = 10) based on area of skin affected, degree of redness, and depth of erosion.
Results: Four hundred sixty-four nursing home residents were assessed and 32.9% (n = 141) met the criteria for inclusion, including 73 subjects in the experimental group and 68 in the control group. Baseline IAD prevalence was comparable in both groups (experimental: 22.3% vs control: 22.8%, P = .76). Baseline IAD severity was 6.9/10 in the experimental group and 7.3/10 in the control group. A significant intervention effect on IAD prevalence was found (experimental: 8.1% vs control: 27.1%, F = 3.1, P = .003). A nonsignificant effect on IAD severity could be determined (experimental: 3.8/10 vs control: 6.9/10, F = 0.8, P = .06).
Conclusion: The use of a 3-in-1 washcloth, impregnated with a 3% dimethicone formula, resulted in a significantly reduced prevalence of IAD and a trend toward less severe lesions. These findings provide indicative evidence for the use of 3-in-1 perineal care washcloth as an effective intervention against the use of water and a pH neutral soap to prevent and/or treat IAD."

Design: In vivo, experimental study.
Subjects and setting: An experimental animal model (guinea pig) in a controlled laboratory setting was used for investigation.
Methods: We developed an IAD model in guinea pigs by occluded application of 1%, 5%, and 10% pancreatin solutions for 1, 3, and 5 days, respectively. The irritant was applied to the posterior aspect of shaved guinea pigs. We used an adapted visual scoring system to evaluate IAD and its severity. We also measured differences of the fluid absorption rate as a proxy for transepidermal water loss and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of interleukin 2 and interferon-Î³ expression as indicators of IAD-related inflammation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine group differences.
Results: Higher pancreatin concentrations led to more severe skin responses and higher mean visual scale scores, yet the statistically score differences were only observed in the 1% and 5% pancreatin groups after 3 and 5 days of exposure compared with 1 day of exposure (P < .05). The average absorbed fluid rate increased from 1 to 3 days of exposure and reached a plateau at 3 days; significant differences were observed in 3 and 5 days of exposure (P < .05) when compared with 1 day of exposure but not between 3 and 5 days of exposure.
Conclusions: Exposure of a guinea pig animal model to 1%, 5%, and 10% pancreatin solutions over a 3-day period induced IAD with different levels of severity. Additional studies using this model are warranted."

Purpose: To determine whether a KOH test, when MDD is suspected, would result in more accurate diagnoses, with decreased antifungal medication prescription and exposure.
Methods: Quality improvement project from 2016 through 2017 with protocol implemented in 2017 for treatment of MDD after positive KOH testing. If monilial rash suspected, after 2 negative KOH tests, then antifungal ordered (considered false negative). Ï testing and cost determination were performed.
Sample: Neonates in 2 level III neonatal intensive care units.
Outcome variables: KOH test results, use of antifungal medication, and cost.
Results: The patient census included 1051 and 1015 patients in the year before and after the protocol initiation. The medical orders for antifungal medication decreased from 143 to 36 (P < .001; 95% odds ratio confidence interval, 2.24-4.38). There was a 75% reduction in both use and cost, as charged, of antifungal agents. Overall charges, including KOH test costs, decreased by 12%. Three infants received multiple negative KOH tests, then a positive one. These met the definition of false-negative tests, per protocol. There were no cases of fungal sepsis.
Implications for practice: Use of a quality improvement protocol, in which the use of KOH testing is required, before antifungal agents are prescribed, results in decreased exposure and costs.
Implications for research: To test the feasibility of bedside ""point-of-care"" KOH testing, and whether KOH testing and reduced antifungal medication use affects antimicrobial resistance or invasive fungal sepsis."

Design: Prospective observational.
Subjects and setting: The sample comprised 351 patients aged 18 years and older in a major metropolitan public hospital ICU in Queensland, Australia.
Methods: All consenting, eligible participants at risk of developing IAD underwent weekly skin inspections to determine the presence of IAD. Data were collected weekly for 52 consecutive weeks. Descriptive statistics described the study sample and logistic regression analysis was used to identify patient characteristics associated with development of IAD.
Results: The weekly IAD prevalence ranged between 0% and 70%, with IAD developing in 17% (n = 59/351) of ICU patients. The odds of IAD developing increased statistically significantly with increasing age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.029, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.005-1.054, P = .016), time in the ICU (OR = 1.104; 95% CI: 1.063-1.147, P < .001), and Bristol Stool chart score (OR = 4.363, 95% CI: 2.091-9.106, P < .001). Patients with respiratory (OR = 3.657, 95% CI: 1.399-9.563, P = .008) and sepsis (OR = 3.230, 95% CI: 1.281-8.146, P = .013) diagnoses had increased odds of developing IAD.
Conclusions: These data show the high variability of IAD prevalence over a 1-year period. Characteristics associated with the development of IAD in patients in the ICU included older age, longer lengths of ICU stay, incontinent of liquid feces, and having respiratory or sepsis diagnoses."
506,506,Reduced-Concentration Clavulanate for Young Children with Acute Otitis Media,2017,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Alejandro Hoberman,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00238-17,"Amoxicillin-clavulanate (A/C) is currently the most effective oral antimicrobial in treating children with acute otitis media (AOM), but the standard dosage of 90 mg amoxicillin/6.4 mg clavulanate/kg of body weight/day commonly causes diarrhea. We examined whether an A/C formulation containing lower concentrations of clavulanate would result in less diarrhea while maintaining plasma levels of amoxicillin and clavulanate adequate to eradicate middle-ear pathogens and to achieve clinical success. We conducted an open-label study in children with AOM who were 6 to 23 months of age. In phase 1, we treated 40 children with a reduced-clavulanate A/C formulation providing 90 mg amoxicillin/3.2 mg clavulanate/kg/day for 10 days. In phase 2, we treated 72 children with the same formulation at a dosage of 80 mg amoxicillin/2.85 mg clavulanate/kg/day for 10 days. We compared the rates of protocol-defined diarrhea (PDD), diaper dermatitis, and AOM clinical response in these children with rates we had reported in children who received the standard A/C regimen, and we obtained plasma levels of amoxicillin and clavulanate at various time points. Outcomes in phase 1 children and in children who had received the standard regimen did not differ significantly. Rates of PDD in children receiving phase 2 and standard regimens were 17% and 26%, respectively (P = 0.10). The corresponding rates of diaper dermatitis were 21% and 33% (P = 0.04) and of AOM treatment failure were 12% and 16% (P = 0.44). Symptomatic responses did not differ significantly between regimens; both gave clavulanate levels sufficient to inhibit Î²-lactamase activity. In young children with AOM, clavulanate dosages lower than those currently used may be associated with fewer side effects without reducing clinical efficacy.

It is frequently complicated by Candida superinfection.
Objective: Comparison of efficacy and safety of two antifungal pastes (Imazol = 1% clotrimazole; Multilind = 100,000 IU nystatin/g + 20% zinc oxide) in infants with DD.
Methods: A total of 96 infants were included in this multi-centre, controlled, randomized, evaluator-blinded phase IV trial and treated with pastes containing either clotrimazole (n = 45) or nystatin (n = 46) twice daily for 14 days. In all, 91 children (age 12.1 +/- 5.3 months; 48 females) with DD were evaluable. Total symptom score after 7 days (TSS7) was assessed as primary parameter. Secondary efficacy parameters were TSS at 14 days (TSS14), clinical and microbiological cure rates and global assessment (GA) of clinical response.
Results: TSS improved markedly with both pastes. Decreases in symptom score were 4.5 +/- 2.1 (day 7) and 6.1 +/- 1.9 (day 14) with clotrimazole compared with 4.2 +/- 2.3 and 5.4 +/- 2.4 with nystatin (P < 0.0001). With respect to TSS14, clotrimazole was superior to nystatin (P = 0.0434). Clinical cure rate was higher with clotrimazole [36.2% (day 7) and 68.1% (day 14)] compared with 28.6% and 46.9% (nystatin). GA was very good in 26 (55.3%) clotrimazole-treated children (nystatin: 16 [32.7%], P = 0.0257). Frequency of adverse events was comparable in both treatment groups.
Conclusion: Clotrimazole was superior to nystatin with respect to reduction in symptom score and GA. Microbiological cure rate was 100% for both agents. Both treatments were safe and well-tolerated."

509,509,Skin interaction with absorbent hygiene products,2008,Clin Dermatol,Bo Runeman,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clindermatol.2007.10.002,"Skin problems due to the use of absorbent hygiene products, such as diapers, incontinence pads, and feminine sanitary articles, are mostly due to climate or chafing discomfort. If these conditions are allowed to prevail, these may develop into an irritant contact dermatitis and eventually superficial skin infections. Skin humidity and aging skin are among the most significant predisposing and aggravating factors for dermatitis development. Improved product design features are believed to explain the decline in observed diaper dermatitis among infants. Where adult incontinence-related skin problems are concerned, it is very important to apply a holistic perspective to understand the influences due to the individual's incontinence level and skin condition, as well as the hygiene and skin care measures provided. Individuals with frail, sensitive skin or with skin diseases may preferably have to use high-quality products, equipped with superabsorbent polymers and water vapor-permeable back sheets, to minimize the risk of skin complications."
510,510,"Determining Risk Factors to Develop a Predictive Model of Incontinence-associated Dermatitis Among Critically Ill Patients with Fecal Incontinence: A Prospective, Quantitative Study",2019,Wound Manag Prev,Li Wei,,"Critically ill patients with fecal incontinence are at high risk of developing incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). Scientific prediction and prevention of IAD are essential.
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for IAD among critically ill patients with fecal incontinence. Based on this information, a predictive risk assessment model was developed to provide research evidence for IAD prevention.
Methods: A prospective study was conducted from October 2016 to December 2017. Convenience sampling was used to recruit patients with fecal incontinence treated in intensive care units (ICUs) at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital in China. Trained nurses collected demographic data (age, gender, and ICU type), data related to fecal incontinence (Perineal Assessment Tool [PAT] scores, bowel movement frequency, and stool traits per the Bristol Stool Scale), and clinical data (length of ICU hospitalization, body temperature, diabetes history, hypertension history, consciousness, nutrition support, oxygen supply, number of antibiotic species, sedative use, and albumin levels) from participants and their medical records. The PAT was used to assess patient risk of developing IAD, and the Bristol Stool Scale was used to assess patient stool traits. Names were coded anonymously, and data were entered from paper-and-pencil questionnaires into a software program for statistical analysis. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for IAD. A predictive risk factor model was established using a receiver operating characteristic curve.
Results: Among 266 critically ill patients with fecal incontinence (182 male, 84 female; mean age 64.18 Â± 17.10), IAD incidence was 65.4%. The use of sedative drugs, coma status, higher PAT score, more frequent bowel movements, and loose stool were found to be independent risk factors for IAD (P <.05). The subsequent risk factor predictive model had a sensitivity and specificity of 99.4% and 96.7%, respectively, and the agreement rate was 98.1%.
Conclusion: The identified risk factors and subsequent predictive model may contribute to timely identification and quantitative risk assessment of IAD among critically ill patients. Additional quantitative research could provide a scientific basis for the development of specific preventive interventions."

Design: Open-label, nonrandomized, prospective study.
Subjects and setting: The sample comprised 16 patients; inclusion criteria were: patients older than 18 years, cared for in the intensive care unit of a level I trauma center hospital or in long-term care facilities in the northeast region of the United States, and had incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). Twelve of the patients had epidermal skin loss and 4 had severe redness.
Methods: The investigational product is a formulation based on acrylate chemistry. The skin protectant application schedule was twice weekly for up to 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 applications during the study period. The skin was evaluated via a skin assessment instrument specifically designed for use in this study; this instrument has not undergone validation studies. The main outcome measure was changes in the instrument score over time. In addition, complete reepithelialization was recorded when observed, and pain scores (associated with IAD) were noted in participants who were able to report pain.
Results: The IAD score improved in 13 of 16 patients, remained unchanged in 1 patient, and deteriorated in 2 patients. The median percent improvement in the skin assessment instrument was 96% (P = .013). Four of the patients with epidermal skin loss had complete reepithelialization of the skin surface with 4 to 6 applications of the skin protectant, and 5 had substantial improvement. The 4 patients with severe red skin returned to healthy normal skin with 2 to 4 skin protectant applications. Substantial pain reduction was reported by all 9 patients who reported pain at enrollment. No adverse events associated with the skin protectant application were reported during data collection.
Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that an acrylate-based product, evaluated here for the first time in patients, may be effective as a protective barrier in the presence of continued incontinence. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings."

A prospective, descriptive study was conducted in 2 acute care neurology units to 1) assess the prevalence of incontinence and incidence of IAD and HAPUs among incontinent patients, and 2) evaluate the effect of caregiver education and use of a 1-step cleanser, moisturizer, barrier product on the development of IAD and HAPUs among patients with incontinence. During a period of 1 month, the incontinence status of admitted patients was recorded and skin was assessed for the presence/absence of IAD and HAPUs twice per day. After the 1-month data collection, all clinicians on the study units completed a facility-based online education program about IAD, HAPUs, and skin care followed by the implementation of a 1-step cleanser/barrier product for skin care of all patients with incontinence. Data collection procedures remained the same. Data were collected using a paper/pencil instrument and entered into a spreadsheet for analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and prevalence and incidence rates were compared between the pre-intervention and post-intervention phase using Fisher's exact analysis. During the first phase of the study, 17 of 40 admitted patients (42.5%) were incontinent. Of those, 5 (29.4%) developed IAD and all of these patients developed HAPUs (5 of 40 admitted, 29.4%) during an average length of stay of 7.3 (range: 2-14) days. In the intervention phase of the study, 25 of 46 (54.3%) patients were incontinent and none developed IAD or a HAPU during an average length of stay of 7.4 (range: 2-14) days. The average Braden scale score was 14.14 in the pre-intervention group of patients with incontinence and 12.74 in the intervention group. The prevalence of incontinence among patients admitted to acute care neurology units and the rate of IAD in these populations is high. After educating clinicians and implementing incontinence care procedures with a 1-step product, the rate of HAPUs decreased significantly but the rate of IADs remained the same. Clinicians should consider the results of this and other studies when developing incontinence-care protocols. Controlled clinical studies utilizing more detailed IAD assessments will help elucidate these observations."

Design: This was a longitudinal, repeated-measures study; data were collected over a 12-week period.
Subjects and setting: One hundred seventy-one patients, with a median age of 55 years. Fifty-four women and 117 men were evaluated. The sample comprises all patients admitted to the 4 LTAC units at the Drake Center in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Methods: Patients were examined using the ""Hospital Survey on Incontinence and Perineal Skin Injury"" instrument within 24 hours of admission and they were reevaluated weekly using the same tool until discharge. All data were collected by the Drake Center Advanced Wound Team. Prevalence was defined as the frequency of PUs or IAD identified at admission. Incidence was calculated using the formula: the number of new IAD cases/the number of patients without IAD on admission. Pressure ulcer incidence was measured using 2 formulas: (1) the number of patients with new PUs/the number of all patients who did not have PU on admission and (2) the number of patients with new PUs or a PU in a new location/the number of all patients.
Results: Thirty-nine out of 171 patients had IAD on admission, yielding a prevalence of 22.8%. Sixty of 171 patients had a PU on admission, yielding a prevalence of 35.1%. Ten of 132 patients who did not have IAD at admission developed IAD during follow-ups, yielding a 7.6% incidence. Two PU incidence rates were measured; those patients without PUs on admission 3.6% (4/111) and all patients 8.2% (14/171).
Conclusion: The LTAC admission PU prevalence rate in this study was greater than that reported previously in acute or long-term care settings. The LTAC PU incidence rate was less than those reported for both acute and long-term care settings. The LTAC IAD admission prevalence rate closely reflected the acute care rate but was substantially higher than the long-term care rate."

A one-year prospective study,1985,Am J Dis Child,G F Hayden,https://doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.1985.02140030038023,"To determine the frequency and nature of skin disorders encountered in a medical center pediatric clinic, we prospectively surveyed 1,547 patient visits during a one-year period. A primary skin complaint had prompted 6% of all of the visits and 9% of the visits that were for reasons other than well-child care. More than 21% of the visits featured either a skin complaint or a skin finding. Among 235 visits by children with primary or secondary skin complaints, the most frequent diagnoses included skin infections (36%), diaper dermatitis (16%), and atopic dermatitis (9%). Although the range of skin lesions encountered was very broad, the great majority (86%) of diagnoses fell within nine general categories. Because dermatologic problems constitute such an important component of primary care pediatric practice, appropriate emphasis should be placed on teaching basic principles of dermatology to pediatricians both during and after residency training."

Method:: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted across nine tertiary hospitals. Registered nurses were trained on a standard approach to injury assessment and examination. The study was carried out at the same time on the same day across the participating centres. Participating patients were examined for PU, ST or IAD.
Results:: A total of 13,176 inpatients were assessed and 233 PU were identified, of which 126 occurred in hospitals, 99 cases at home and eight cases within community hospitals. In addition, there were 141 skin tears and 97 IADs.
Conclusion:: This study involved the largest number of hospitals, to date (in China). Therefore, the prevalence and rate of incidence of skin injury obtained in this study may represent a regional baseline in China."

If the skin experiences too much moisture, it becomes overhydrated and is prone to maceration. This makes it easier for irritants and microorganisms to penetrate the skin, reduce its integrity to mechanical forces and disrupt its protective acid mantle. The condition can greatly affect patient wellbeing. MASD is a collective definition and it has four main causes: incontinence-associated dermatitis, periwound skin damage, intertriginous dermatitis and peristomal moisture-associated dermatitis. Practitioners can use tools such as the Skin Moisture Alert Reporting Tool (S.M.A.R.T.) to identify its aetiology, which informs its management. Management of MASD involves assessment, addressing the underlying cause, and implementing a structured skin care regimen to treat it and prevent its recurrence. Case studies illustrate the use of a structured treatment strategy using Medi Derma barrier products and the principles of Total Barrier Protection to provide a cost-effective solution for the prevention and management of skin compromised by MASD."

The gastrointestinal tract is frequently affected resulting in nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and profuse diarrhoea (Washington and Jagasia, 2009) which can be both distressing and humiliating for patients. The volume of watery, green diarrhoea produced can be greater than 2 litres per day (Ferrara et al, 2009) and is one indicator of the severity of GvHD. It may, in some cases, lead to faecal incontinence. Management of GvHD-associated diarrhoea involves the use of high-dose steroids to control the exaggerated immune response, anti-diarrhoeal medication, management of fluid and electrolytes, and nutritional management. It may also require management of faecal incontinence and prevention of incontinence-associated dermatitis. This paper describes the pathology of GvHD, the management of GvHD-associated diarrhoea and faecal incontinence and discusses the potential use of a faecal management system inappropriately selected individuals with uncontrolled diarrhoea and limited mobility."

Diagnostic agreement between paediatricians and dermatologists evaluating the patients separately was assessed. Three hundred and ninety-five children (median age 3 years; interquartile 1-6) were included. Skin disorders represented 4% of all paediatric emergency care unit visits. Visits were considered as appropriate in 19-30% of cases according to different criteria. Six diseases accounted for 57% of cases: viral exanthema, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, varicella, diaper dermatitis and herpetic gingivostomatitis. The dermatologist modified the diagnosis in 42% of cases and the treatment in 30%. Greater emphasis on teaching the skin disorders encountered in this setting and efforts to provide easy access to advice from dermatologist would improve the quality of care."

Outcomes: The outcomes included skin integrity or skin condition.
Results: Nineteen studies were included in the review. Twelve studies included a randomized design. Barriers were the main interventions for the prevention of pressure injury, medical adhesive skin injury, diaper dermatitis, and general skin condition. The types of barriers included hydrocolloids, polyurethane-based dressings, film-forming skin protectant, or emollients. Nonbarrier interventions included rotation between a mask and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) interfaces, utilization of prescribed guidelines to decrease pressure injuries, and use of a lower concentration of chlorhexidine gluconate as a disinfectant."

A 1-day skin prevalence audit was conducted in the spring of 2005 in a tertiary care university-affiliated children's hospital. Patient skin was assessed for any alterations. The Braden Q Scale was used to assess patient risk for pressure ulcer development. Alterations in skin integrity included diaper dermatitis, pressure ulcers, intravenous infiltrations, device-related injuries, and epidermal injuries. Many patients required additional skin care, including wound/incision care, ostomy care, and care related to invasive devices. Alterations in skin integrity represent a serious problem in the pediatric inpatient setting. The data presented identify skin integrity challenges in the hospitalized patient and can help guide staff education and resource allocation, encourage evidenced-based management protocols, and serve as a benchmark for similar pediatric facilities."
521,521,[Congenital cutaneous candidiasis: report of two cases],1990,Zhonghua Min Guo Xiao Er Ke Yi Xue Hui Za Zhi,C B Chiou,,"Congenital cutaneous candidiasis is a very rare disease. We reported two newborn infants in whom generalized skin eruption was noted at birth, characteristics of erythematous papules and pustules. The eruption involved head, face, neck, trunk and extremities. Candida albicans was demonstrated on direct KOH smear, by surface fungal cultures and skin biopsy. The disease implies a congenital intrauterine infection and is different from neonatal candidiasis which manifests as thrush, diaper dermatitis. The route of infection is ascending in congenital cutaneous candidiasis. The skin eruption is usually noted at birth or within 12 hours after delivery as a diffuse erythematous maculopapula, with pustules or vesicles distributed over head, face, neck, trunk and extremities. There is no fever; other constitutional signs are lacking. No evidence of impaired immunological responsiveness has been noted in previous study. Clinical features, direct smear examination of specimen and appropriate cultures are useful in differentiating the lesions from other more common dermatoses of the neonatal period. Topical antifungal therapy is sufficient unless systemic candidiasis is present. Prognosis for congenital cutaneous candidiasis is good."
522,522,Cultivating Incontinence-associated Dermatitis Prevention Practices in an Australian Local Health District: A Quasi-experimental Study,2018,Ostomy Wound Manage,Michelle Barakat-Johnson,,"Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is a common, painful, difficult-to-treat skin condition.
Purpose: A 2-part, quasi-experimental, post-test study was conducted to evaluate the impact of prevention initiatives on IAD prevalence and incontinence practices.
Method: In part 1, from May 2017 to November 2017, a quasi-experimental post-test study design was conducted in a health district in Australia. Following an audit of IAD prevalence and identification of evidence practice gaps in 4 hospitals in a local health district (12 wards, 250 patients), an implementation science approach was used to implement evidence-based initiatives. An IAD committee was formed, staff were educated about correct incontinence pad sizing, washable and disposable underpads and plastic sheets were removed from the care setting, and barrier cream cloths for cleansing, moisturizing, and protecting skin were introduced. Patients admitted to 1 of the 12 wards who were â¥18 years of age were recruited for participation and evaluation in the post-intervention implementation IAD and incontinence care practices audit. Post-intervention data were entered into a software program and compared to pre-implementation data using descriptive and bivariate statistics. In part 2, nurses from the 12 wards were asked to participate in 1 of 6 focus groups to share their impressions about the barrier cream cloths. Discussions were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using descriptive content analysis.
Results: The rate of incontinence among audited patients (N= 259, 132 men, 124 women; mean age 73.2 Â± 16.8 years) was 47.2% (119/252) and 2/259 (0.8%) had a pressure injury (PI). IAD prevalence was significantly lower in the post- than in the pre-implementation audit (6/259 vs 23/250, P = .015), as was hospital-acquired pressure injury (9/250 [3.6%] vs 2/259 [0.08%]) and the use of bed protection layers (154/238 vs 6/259; P <.01). The focus groups included 31 nurses (25 women, 6 men). Four (4) themes emerged: 1) benefits to the patient (eg, improved skin condition), 2) usability (eg, fewer steps), 3) problems encountered (eg, not seeing the barrier in place), and 4) related factors. Patient comfort was cited frequently as an important benefit.
Conclusion: Evidence-based initiatives led to a significant reduction in IAD prevalence and improved incontinence care practices. ."

Design: The design was experimental, as conditions were applied to skin and skin pH was measured in random order, and subjects served as their own controls.
Setting and subjects: The setting was a Midwestern nonprofit nursing home. The sample was 26 nursing home residents; their mean age was 87 years (SD = 6 years); 77% were female. Most (69%) had urinary incontinence alone, and 31% had dual urinary and fecal incontinence.
Methods: Skin pH was measured in duplicate on 6 areas of the inner thighs and 6 areas of the volar surface of the forearms. Each area was exposed to 1 of 6 conditions applied in random order: an incontinence brief containing spiral-shaped fiber wet with an alkaline solution and one that was dry; a standard incontinence brief (without spiral-shaped fiber) wet with the same alkaline solution and one that was dry; the alkaline solution alone; and normal skin.
Results: On both the thighs and the forearms, skin pH was significantly lower (more acidic) after exposure to the incontinence brief containing spiral-shaped fiber wet with an alkaline solution compared to the wet standard brief and all other control conditions (P < .001). On thighs, the mean skin pH was 5.7 (SD = 0.5) after exposure to the wet brief with spiral-shaped fiber versus 6.4 (SD = 0.5) after exposure to the wet standard brief. On forearms, the mean skin pH was 5.3 (SD = 0.4) after exposure to the wet brief with spiral-shaped fiber versus 6.0 (SD = 0.4) after exposure to the wet standard brief.
Conclusions: Incontinence briefs containing a spiral-shaped fiber significantly acidify the pH of the skin exposed to an alkaline solution, while industry standard briefs do not. Since alkaline skin pH is a risk factor for incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), results suggest that briefs with spiral-shaped fiber may help prevent IAD. Findings encourage further research."

Data were collected over a 15-month period from 347 patients on four in-patient units (PICU, medical-surgical, oncology, and adolescents) on skin breakdown using the AHCPR staging guidelines and compared to the total score on the Starkid SkinScale in order to determine its ability to predict skin breakdown. The inter-rater reliability of the Starkid Skin Scale was r2 = 0.85 with an internal reliablity of 0.71. The sensitivity of the total score was low (17.5%) but highly specific (98.5%). The prevalence of skin breakdown in the acutely hospitalized child was 23%, the majority (77.5%) occurring as erythema of the skin. Buttocks, perineum, and occiput were the most common locations of breakdown. Occiput breakdown was more common in critically ill (PICU) patients while diaper dermatitis was more common in the general medical-surgical population."

A female preponderance (52%) was observed, and infants constituted the largest group within the patient population (28.7%). A total of 162 dermatoses were recorded. Atopic dermatitis was the most prevalent dermatosis (31.3%), followed by viral warts (13.1%), alopecia areata (6.7%), pityriasis alba (5.25%), psoriasis (4%), and diaper dermatitis (4%). Atopic dermatitis was the most frequently seen dermatosis in children of all age groups, whereas, viral warts were more prevalent in school-age children. The prevalence of alopecia areata and psoriasis was higher than reported earlier in other ethnic groups. A female preponderance was seen in children with alopecia areata, psoriasis, vitiligo, acne vulgaris, contact dermatitis, and pityriasis rosea.

At 12 months of age, infants fed cow milk had significantly lower mean serum ferritin levels and mean corpuscular volume, higher free erythrocyte protoporphyrin values, and greater incidence of hemoglobin values less than 11 g/dl than did formula-fed infants. There were no significant differences in frequency of otitis media, wheezing episodes, nasal discharge or congestion, diaper dermatitis, constipation, guaiac-positive stools, or hospital admissions between the two groups. These data suggest that, to avoid iron deficiency, infants should continue to receive iron-fortified formula throughout the first year of life or a daily iron supplement if they are fed whole cow milk before their first birthday."

Hemangiomas, viral, fungal and bacterial infections, omphalitis, atopic and seborrhoeic dermatitis, napkin disease will be treated and discussed. Expert opinion: The majority of the dermatologic alterations in neonates are physiological, transient and do not require any treatment, thus the parents can be reassured about the good prognosis. However, in some cases, serious conditions must be excluded. In particular neonatal and infantile infections should be promptly recognized and properly managed, to avoid severe complications. The therapeutic options include traditional and, although few, innovative medical treatments, which will be carefully taken into consideration by the expert Dermatologists and Paediatricians."

Design: Descriptive and correlational analysis of data from a large database of IAD, and pressure injuries of sacral area and heels.
Subjects and setting: The sample comprised 5342 adult patients in acute care facilities in 36 states representing all regions of the United States. Facilities used a variety of products for prevention of IAD and sacral area pressure injuries.
Methods: Data were collected for use in a national quality improvement study evaluating current practices related to the prevention of IAD and pressure injuries affecting the sacral area and heels. Data were exported to a spreadsheet, and triple checked for accuracy before being imported to a statistical analysis software program. Descriptive statistics were used to describe prevalence rates for incontinence, types of incontinence, IAD, characteristics of IAD, and pressure injuries. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted on the end point of facility-acquired sacral/buttock pressure injury and the risk factors of immobility and type of incontinence.
Results: More than one-third of patients (n = 2492 of 5342 patients; 46.6%) were incontinent of urine, stool, or both. The overall prevalence rate of IAD was 21.3% (1140/5342); the prevalence of IAD among patients with incontinence was 45.7% (1140/2492). Slightly more than half of the IAD was categorized as mild (596/1140, 52.3%), 27.9% (318/1140) was categorized as moderate, and 9.2% (105/1140) was deemed severe. In addition, 14.8% (169/1140) of patients with IAD also had a fungal rash. The prevalence of pressure injury in the sacral area among individuals with incontinence was 17.1% (427/2492), and the prevalence of full-thickness pressure injury in this population was 3.8% (95/2492). Multivariate analysis revealed that both presence of IAD (odds ratio [OR], 4.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.68-5.65) and immobility (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.73-4.63) was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of developing a sacral pressure injury. Multivariate analysis also revealed that presence of IAD (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.74-4.03) and immobility (OR, 6.05; 95% CI, 3.14-11.64) was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of developing full-thickness sacral pressure injury.
Conclusion: Our study findings are consistent with prior research, supporting a clinically relevant association between IAD and pressure injury of the sacral area. This risk persists even after controlling for presence of immobility, suggesting that IAD functions as an independent risk factor for pressure injury occurrence."
529,529,Gerontodermatology: the fragility of the epidermis in older adults,2018,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,N Katoh,https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.15253,"The proportion of adults over 60 years of age is rapidly increasing and is estimated to reach approximately one-sixth of the global population by 2030. An ageing population is a real challenge for healthcare resources, including dermatologists and geriatricians, as age-related changes in skin integrity and barrier function make older adults more susceptible to developing skin pathologies such as pruritus, dermatitis and infections. Fragile skin arises from several interlinked causes, including age-related changes in skin barrier integrity, previous and current lifestyle choices, skin pathologies and medical interventions. Dermo-cosmetics can play a key role in enhancing skin care regimens and preventing pathologies in this age group. In vitro studies, clinical, and in-daily clinical practice studies of dermo-cosmetics have shown them to be effective in many skin conditions in older adults, like xerosis and pruritus. Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), a common condition arising from contact with irritants such as urine and faeces which can significantly impact the quality of life of sufferers, can also be improved with a barrier cream in incontinent patients aged 70 years and older. This supplement focuses on the increased fragility of older skin, the development of common skin pathologies and the efficacy and tolerance of dermo-cosmetic products in older adults."

Adequate skin care strategies are an effective method for maintaining and enhancing skin health and integrity in this population.
Objectives: The objective was to summarize the empirical evidence about the effects and effectiveness of non-drug topical skin care interventions to promote and to maintain skin integrity and skin barrier function in the aged, to identify outcome domains and outcome measurement instruments in this field.
Design: An update of a previous systematic review published in 2013 was conducted.
Data sources: Databases MEDLINE and EMBASE via OvidSP and CINAHL (original search January 1990 to August 2012, update September 2012 to May 2018) and reference lists were searched. Forward searches in Web of Science were conducted.
Methods: A review protocol was registered in Prospero (CRD42018100792). Main inclusion criteria were primary intervention studies reporting treatment effects of basic skin care strategies in aged people with a lower limit of age range of 50 years and published between 1990 and 2018. Primary empirical studies were included with experimental study designs including randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs. Methodological quality of included randomized controlled trials was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's Tool for assessing risk of bias. Levels of evidence were assigned to all included studies.
Results: Sixty-three articles were included in the final analysis reporting effects of interventions to treat and/or to prevent skin dryness, pruritus, general skin barrier improvement, incontinence-associated dermatitis, skin tears and pressure ulcers. Skin cleansers containing syndets or amphotheric surfactants compared with standard soap and water improved skin dryness. Lipophilic leave-on products containing humectants decreased skin dryness and reduced pruritus. Products with pH 4 improved the skin barrier. Application of skin protectants and structured skin care protocols decreased the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis. Formulations containing glycerin and petrolatum reduced the incidence of skin tears. Thirty-five outcome domains were identified with nearly 100 different outcome measurement instruments.
Conclusion: Included studies showed substantial heterogeneity regarding design, interventions and outcomes. Basic skin care strategies including low-irritating cleansers and lipophilic humectant-containing leave-on products are helpful for treating dry skin and improving skin barrier in the aged. Lower pH of leave-on products improves the skin barrier. The number of different outcome domains was unexpectedly high. We recommend to identify critical outcome domains in the field of skin care to make trial results more comparable in the future and to measure possible performance differences between different skin care strategies and products."

The objective of this study was to examine the evidence supporting the dermatological use of seaweed, witch hazel, bearberry, and mayapple.
Methods: Four plants and algae used in traditional First Nations treatments of skin disease were selected based on expert recommendations. Several databases were searched to identify relevant citations without language restrictions.
Results: Seaweed has potential clinical use in the treatment of acne and wrinkles and may be incorporated into biofunctional textiles. Witch hazel is an effective and well-tolerated treatment of inflammation and diaper dermatitis. Bearberry leaves contain arbutin, a skin-lightening agent that is an alternative for the treatment of hyperpigmentation. Mayapple contains podophyllotoxin, a treatment for condyloma accuminata, molluscum contagiosum, and recalcitrant palmoplantar warts.
Discussion: Common plants and algae are replete with bioactive agents that may have beneficial effects on the skin. Further research will open the door to new and innovative products in the future. Limitations of this study include that the scope of our study is limited to 4 plants and algae, a small sample of the breadth of plants used by First Nations for dermatological treatments."

The aim of the present retrospective study was to determine the amount per application and the daily exposure for some of the most commonly used baby cosmetic products. Consumption data from 48 clinical studies performed on 1481 babies and children (from 0 to 10 years old) were reviewed and used to conduct a probabilistic evaluation of dermal exposure. Six categories of products were reviewed: rinseoff products for hair and body; rinse-off products for the whole body; leave-on products for face and body; cleansers for face and body; diaper dermatitis treatment products; shampoos. Subjects were provided with products and recorded detailed daily usage information over a 1-4-week period, depending on the study. Products were weighed at the start and upon completion of each study in order to determine the total amount of product used. The mean, median, standard deviation and 95th percentile were calculated for daily consumption and exposure, for several age groups from 0 to 10 years old. This study provides current baby cosmetic exposure information for commonly used products which will be useful for risk assessment purposes."

After receiving parenteral antibiotics for a mean of 3.7 days, children were discharged home to receive cefuroxime axetil suspension at doses of 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours for a mean of 8.2 days. One child was lost to follow-up. Three of 35 evaluated patients were withdrawn from therapy because of adverse events, one of which was a drug-related hypersensitivity reaction. Of the 32 children who completed therapy, 9 developed mild reactions including oral thrush, diarrhea, or diaper dermatitis; none were withdrawn from therapy. Complete clinical cure occurred in 28 children (80 percent); 4 (11.4 percent) were clinically improved but still required an additional antibiotic within one week of completing therapy with cefuroxime axetil suspension. This favorable tolerability and safety of cefuroxime axetil suspension warrants further efficacy trials in pediatric patients."
534,534,Characterization of the microbiome in the infant diapered area: Insights from healthy and damaged skin,2020,Exp Dermatol,Amber Teufel,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14198,"It has been recognized for nearly a century that human beings are inhabited by a remarkably dense and diverse microbial ecosystem, yet we are only just beginning to understand and appreciate the many roles that these microbes play in human health and development. Establishment of the microbiome begins at birth, but many previous studies on infant skin health have focused on Candida species. Little is known on the full microbial composition across different areas and even less is known on how these communities change during disease/inflammatory states. In this clinical study, infants were recruited during periods of diaper dermatitis (DD) and health to characterize the skin microbiome in these two states. Substantial shifts in the skin microbiome were observed across four sites in the diapered area (genitals, intertriginous, buttocks and perianal), as well as during periods of DD. As DD scores increased, there was a shift in relative abundance that demonstrated higher community percentages of faecal coliforms, such as Enterococcus, and lower percentages of Staphylococcus strains. In high-rash samples, the predominant Staphylococcus species is S aureus, potentially implicating S aureus as a DD aetiological agent. This study provides new information related to the microbiome on infant skin in the diapered area and provides insights into the role of the microbiome in the development of DD."

Case report],2018,Rev Chil Pediatr,Javiera Hansen S,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0370-41062018005000302,"Introduction: Cushing's syndrome (CS) is an endocrine disease by to glucocorticoids excess, depen dent or independent of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The main cause is iatrogenic due to excessive use of glucocorticoids.
Objective: To show the association between prolonged use of topical corticosteroids and the development of CS.
Clinical case: An infant treated with topical corticosteroids due to seborrheic dermatitis. Due to long-term unsupervised use, he develops Cushing's syndrome characterized by obesity and compromised growth rate. Topical use of corticosteroids was discontinued and physiological replacement therapy was initiated with descending doses, achieving clinical improvement.
Discussion: Topical corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice for management of dermatological pathologies. These are available in various presentations with va riable efficiency. The main determining factors in its action are the characteristics of the skin, the active principle of the drug, the potency and application technique, so that the adverse effects are observed more frequently in the use due to diaper dermatitis. The main adverse effect of long-term use is Cushing's syndrome which can be prevented through supervised use and progressive decrease.
Conclusion: The rational and careful use of topical corticosteroids is essential to take advantage of the beneficial effects and avoid adverse effects."
536,536,Interventions for preventing and treating incontinence-associated dermatitis in adults,2016,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Dimitri Beeckman,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011627.pub2,"Background: Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is one of the most common skin problems in adults who are incontinent for urine, stool, or both. In practice, products and procedures are the same for both prevention and treatment of IAD.
Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of various products and procedures to preventand treat incontinence-associated dermatitis in adults.
Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 28 September 2016). Additionally we searched other electronic databases: CENTRAL(2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1946 to May Week 3 2015), MEDLINE In-Process (inception to 26 May 2015), CINAHL(December 1981 to 28 May 2015), Web of Science (WoS; inception to 28 May 2015) and handsearched conference proceedings (to June 2015) and the reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors and experts in the field.
Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, performed in any healthcare setting, with included participants over 18 years of age, with or without IAD. We included trials comparing the (cost) effectiveness of topical skin care products such as skin cleansers, moisturisers, and skin protectants of different compositions and skin care procedures aiming to prevent and treat IAD.
Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-texts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials.
Main results: We included 13 trials with 1295 participants in a qualitative synthesis. Participants were incontinent for urine, stool, or both, and were residents in a nursing home or were hospitalised.Eleven trials had a small sample size and short follow-up periods. .The overall risk of bias in the included studies was high. The data were not suitable for meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in participant population, skin care products, skin care procedures, outcomes, and measurement tools.Nine trials compared different topical skin care products, including a combination of products. Two trials tested a structured skin care procedure. One trial compared topical skin care products alongside frequencies of application. One trial compared frequencies of application of topical skin care products.We found evidence in two trials, being of low and moderate quality, that soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD (primary outcomes of this review). The first trial indicated that the use of a skin cleanser might be more effective than the use of soap and water (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.87; low quality evidence). The second trial indicated that a structured skin care procedure, being a washcloth with cleansing, moisturising, and protecting properties, might be more effective than soap and water (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.79; moderate quality evidence). Findings from the other trials, all being of low to very low quality, suggest that applying a leave-on product (moisturiser, skin protectant, or a combination) might be more effective than not applying a leave-on product. No trial reported on the third primary outcome 'number of participants not satisfied with treatment' or on adverse effects.
Authors' conclusions: Little evidence, of very low to moderate quality, exists on the effects of interventions for preventing and treating IAD in adults. Soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD. Application of leave-on products (moisturisers, skin protectants, or a combination) and avoiding soap seems to be more effective than withholding these products. The performance of leave-on products depends on the combination of ingredients, the overall formulation and the usage (e.g. amount applied). High quality confirmatory trials using standardised, and comparable prevention and treatment regimens in different settings/regions are required. Furthermore, to increase the comparability of trial results, we recommend the development of a core outcome set, including validated measurement tools. The evidence in this review is current up to 28 September 2016."
537,537,Issues related to accurate classification of buttocks wounds,2011,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Mary Mahoney,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0b013e31822fc3e5,"Purpose: This study was designed to determine the level of agreement among wound care nurses when asked to classify the etiology of 9 wounds located on the buttocks and within the intergluteal cleft.
Subjects: Study subjects were 100 wound care nurses who responded to an invitation placed on the WOCN Society's wound care forum and to an e-mail sent to members of the WOCN Iowa Affiliate.
Methods: Respondents were asked to view 9 unique wound photos and to determine whether the primary etiologic factor was pressure, moisture, incontinence-associated dermatitis, or skin tear. Subjects were given no background information regarding the patients but were allowed to add comments.
Results: The overall Îº analysis of the 9 photos combined was 0.1708 (99% confidence interval, 0.1630-0.1786). The testing of the overall Îº for the 9 photos equaling ""0"" or mere chance produced a P < .0001. Analyses revealed that the agreement between the 100 respondents for the 9 photos was only 17% better than chance alone. In summary, our study revealed only ""Slight Agreement"" between wound care nurses' classifications of photo subgroups or for all 9 photos analyzed together.
Implications: Accurate wound classification impacts not only treatment decisions but also reimbursement, risk of litigation, and accuracy of data regarding prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers. It is, therefore, critical for professional societies such as the WOCN to begin development of consensus definitions and guidelines to ensure consistency and accuracy in wound classification."

Effect on skin condition,2000,Dermatology,M R Odio,https://doi.org/10.1159/000018366,"Background: Diaper dermatitis is a common childhood affliction. Aiming to help reduce the prevalence of this problem, we have developed a novel diaper to deliver to the skin dermatological formulations intended to help protect the skin from overhydration and irritation.
Objective: To determine the clinical benefits of a novel disposable diaper designed to deliver a petrolatum-based formulation continuously to the skin during use.
Methods: Two independent, blinded, randomized clinical trials were conducted, involving an aggregate total of 391 children, 8-24 months of age. All comparisons were done versus a control diaper, identical to the test product except for the absence of the petrolatum formulation. The studies determined the effects of the novel diaper on skin erythema and diaper rash.
Results: Use of the formulation-treated diaper was associated with significant reductions in severity of erythema and diaper rash compared to the control product.
Conclusions: The results demonstrated the clinical benefits associated with continuous topical administration of a petrolatum-based formulation by this novel diaper. We anticipate that this advance in diaper design will contribute significantly to further reduce the prevalence and severity of irritant contact dermatitis in the diaper area."

An in vivo screening human model,1998,Contact Dermatitis,H Zhai,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1998.tb05683.x,"2 acute irritants and 1 allergen were selected: sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) representative of irritant household and occupational contact dermatitis, the combination of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and urea to simulate diaper dermatitis, and Rhus to evaluate the effect of model protective materials. The putative protective materials and vehicle were applied to both ventral forearms of 10 subjects in each group, according to a randomized code. Test materials were spread over a marked 2.0 cm2 area, massaged in, allowed to dry for 30 min, and reapplied with another 30 min drying period. The model irritants and allergen were then applied (0.025 ml) to an Al-test occlusive patch, which in turn was placed for 24 h over each of the 8 designated sites. Inflammation was scored according to a clinical scale 72 h post-application. Paraffin wax plus Acetulan in cetyl alcohol, and beeswax plus Acetulan in cetyl alcohol, markedly (p < 0.001) suppressed SLS irritation. Paraffin wax plus beeswax in cetyl alcohol, and Acetulan in cetyl alcohol reduced NH4OH and urea irritation (p < 0.05), paraffin wax in cetyl alcohol significantly (p < 0.01) decreasing Rhus allergic contact dermatitis. This model, provides an easy approach to screening protectants. Its clinical significance requires comparison with an open rather than an occluded challenge."
540,540,Using Alternative Light Source Technology to Enhance Visual Inspection of the Skin,2018,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Lisa Owens,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000448,"Background: The identification of deep tissue pressure injury (DTPI) in the early stages of evolution presents a challenge, as skin compromise is only visually apparent when evidence of damage reaches its outer layers.
Case description: We describe use of an alternative light source (ALS) to enhance visual skin assessment in 3 cases. Case 1 was a 47-year-old African American man with a hyperpigmented inner buttocks and a mixture of partial- and shallow full-thickness skin loss from incontinence-associated dermatitis and friction. Case 2 was a 62-year-old African American woman with a gluteal cleft DTPI. Case 3 was a 57-year-old African American woman with a stage 3 pressure injury of the right buttock.
Conclusion: The ALS enabled visualization of skin nuances not visible to the unaided eye. Based on this experience, we conclude that use of an ALS provided additional visual details when compared to traditional visual inspection. We found that as the ALS interplays with skin layers, penetrating and absorbing at differing depths, compromised skin appeared darker and more distinct when compared to adjacent, intact skin. Additional research is needed to determine whether the ALS enables earlier pressure injury detection, timelier and more effective intervention, decreased morbidity, and cost savings."
541,541,The Impact of Microclimate on Skin Health With Absorbent Incontinence Product Use: An Integrative Review,2018,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Sabrina S Falloon,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000449,"This integrative review considers the role of skin occlusion and microclimate in incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), with a particular focus on disposable, body-worn, absorbent incontinence products. Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, the primary causes of IAD are well-established: occluded skin, in prolonged contact with urine and/or feces and exposed to abrasive forces, is more likely to be affected, and each of these factors can be influenced by wearing absorbent incontinence products. Studies comparing the effect of various absorbent products on skin health have been hindered by the many differences between compared products, making it difficult to clearly attribute any differences in performance to particular materials or design features. Nevertheless, the large and significant differences that have sometimes been found invite further work. Breathable back sheets can significantly reduce the temperature of occluded skin and the humidity of the adjacent air, and several treatments for nonwoven top sheet materials (used next to the skin) have been shown to impart antimicrobial properties in the laboratory, but an impact on IAD incidence or severity has yet to be demonstrated directly. Recent work to introduce sensing technology into absorbent incontinence products to reduce the exposure of skin to urine and feces, by encouraging prompt product changing, seems likely to yield measurable benefits in terms of reducing incidents of IAD as the technology develops. Published work to date suggests that there is considerable potential for products to be engineered to play a significant role in the reduction of IAD among users."
542,542,The 2003 national pediatric pressure ulcer and skin breakdown prevalence survey: a multisite study,2004,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Kathleen M McLane,https://doi.org/10.1097/00152192-200407000-00004,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence of pressure ulcers and other types of skin breakdown in hospitalized children.
Design: This descriptive study included documentation of findings from chart reviews and physical assessments of children.
Setting and subjects: Nine children's hospitals from throughout the United States participated for a total sample of 1064 children. Subjects were inpatients in the children's hospitals between the ages of neonate to 17 years.
Instruments: The data collection tools included the interrater reliability quiz, the patient data collection form, FAST data collection software, the Braden Q Risk Assessment Scale, and the Neonatal/Infant Braden Q Risk Assessment Scale.
Methods: Prevalence of pressure ulcers and skin breakdown was measured on a predetermined day during an 8-hour period at each institution. Eight hospitals required a signed informed consent before study participation; 1 hospital's institutional review board waived consent. A physical skin assessment was done on each inpatient, and all pressure ulcers found were staged according to the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel staging system. A chart review was done on all subjects to collect information on patient demographics and potential risk factors. The Neonatal/Infant Braden Q Risk Assessment was scored for infants younger than 1 year old, and the Braden Q Risk Assessment for children 1 year and older. Patient data collection forms were completed, and all data were entered into the FAST data collection software at the end of the study day. Analyses of data and reports were generated from a central site.
Results: There were 1,064 children surveyed, with a pressure ulcer prevalence of 4.0% and other skin breakdown prevalence of 14.8%. Ninety-two percent of the pressure ulcers were partial thickness, Stages I and II. Sixty-six percent of the pressure ulcers were facility associated. Locations of pressure ulcers were predominately in the head area 31%, seat area 20%, and foot area 19%. The 3 most common types of skin breakdown were excoriation/diaper dermatitis, skin tear, and IV extravasation. Predominant locations for skin breakdown were seat area 35%, foot area 20%, and upper extremities 18%.
Conclusions: The prevalence of pressure ulcers was low in the pediatric population studied, but skin breakdown prevalence (excluding pressure ulcers) was higher, with 74% of all wound types consisting of excoriation/diaper dermatitis, skin tears, and IV extravasation sites. Future studies are needed to evaluate prevention and treatment options for pressure ulcers and skin breakdown in this population. Repeating this multisite study at intervals may be beneficial to continue to build and modify the benchmark data."
543,543,Faecal enzymes: in vivo human skin irritation,1994,Contact Dermatitis,P H Andersen,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1994.tb00696.x,"Digestive enzymes in faeces have been reported to possess skin irritation potential. The present study was designed to investigate the in vivo irritant potentials of faecal concentrations of proteolytic and lipolytic digestive enzymes in bile salt mixtures. In a 21-day cumulative irritation assay, clinical evaluation and noninvasive bioengineering techniques were used. 5 days occlusive exposure to phosphate buffer (pH = 8) caused no visual skin damage but reflectance spectroscopy demonstrated significant vasodilation (p < 0.01) and increases in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin pH were also observed (p < 0.01). These increases were still present at days 12 and 19. Occlusive exposure to physiologic concentrations of faecal enzymes resulted in significant visual and objective scores at day 5, 12, and 19, with increased readings as a function of exposure time (p < 0.01). The enzyme mixture containing lipase caused delayed onset of skin erythema and epidermal barrier disruption compared to elastase and chymotrypsin containing solutions. Prolonged occlusive exposure to digestive enzymes in faecal concentrations caused severe skin erythema and epidermal barrier disruption in a human model, suggesting a possible etiologic role of digestive enzymes in perianal, circumstomal or diaper dermatitis."
544,544,[Major eosinophilia in a premature infant induced by topical ketoconazole],2000,Ann Dermatol Venereol,J L Michel,,"Introduction: Ketoconazole is a member of a newer group of imidazole antifungals. Except for treatment of oral candidiasis, there is no reported experience of use in neonates. Thus, its use in neonatalogy must be considered experimental. Herein we report a major eosinophilia in a very low birth weight neonate induced by transcutaneous resorption of topical ketoconazole.
Case report: A 26 week premature was intubated and ventilated for a hyaline membrane disease. At more than 2 weeks, he developed diaper dermatitis with Candida albicans. Treatment consisted of local application of ketoconazole. After 6 days of application, WBC showed a major eosinophilia [20,000/microL]. Discontinuation of the drug was followed by a prompt normalization of the eosinophil count. The challenge test by topical ketoconazole reproduced eosinophilia, implicating this drug, which, to our knowledge, has not been described previously to cause eosinophilia in very low weight neonates.
Discussion: Peripheral eosinophilia is an uncommon finding present in a relatively limited number of conditions in children. A minor eosinophilia often seen in premature neonates may in part be due to intubation. This case illustrates the potential danger of percutaneous application of drugs in newborn and infants as it has previously been pointed out way various chemicals. Any deterioration of the corneal layer such as observed in many dermatosis prompts an increase in the cutaneous permeability. Immaturity of the premature skin may have aiso played a role. Dermatologists should be aware of potential toxic topical ointments before prescribing them to very low weight babies."
545,545,"Guideline: Vulvovaginal candidosis (AWMF 015/072, level S2k)",2021,Mycoses,Alex Farr,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13248,"Approximately 70-75% of women will have vulvovaginal candidosis (VVC) at least once in their lifetime. In premenopausal, pregnant, asymptomatic and healthy women and women with acute VVC, Candida albicans is the predominant species. The diagnosis of VVC should be based on clinical symptoms and microscopic detection of pseudohyphae. Symptoms alone do not allow reliable differentiation of the causes of vaginitis. In recurrent or complicated cases, diagnostics should involve fungal culture with species identification. Serological determination of antibody titres has no role in VVC. Before the induction of therapy, VVC should always be medically confirmed. Acute VVC can be treated with local imidazoles, polyenes or ciclopirox olamine, using vaginal tablets, ovules or creams. Triazoles can also be prescribed orally, together with antifungal creams, for the treatment of the vulva. Commonly available antimycotics are generally well tolerated, and the different regimens show similarly good results. Antiseptics are potentially effective but act against the physiological vaginal flora. Neither a woman with asymptomatic colonisation nor an asymptomatic sexual partner should be treated. Women with chronic recurrent Candida albicans vulvovaginitis should undergo dose-reducing maintenance therapy with oral triazoles. Unnecessary antimycotic therapies should always be avoided, and non-albicans vaginitis should be treated with alternative antifungal agents. In the last 6 weeks of pregnancy, women should receive antifungal treatment to reduce the risk of vertical transmission, oral thrush and diaper dermatitis of the newborn. Local treatment is preferred during pregnancy."

Various iatrogenic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are also conducive to iatrogenic damage. This study was to review the neonates admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit who needed wound management, and to assess the most common skin injuries and wounds, and their aetiology.
Methods: Data were extracted from medical records of neonates who needed wound management in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2013. Information about gestational age, sex, birth weight, area of involvement, wound aetiology, and therapy were collected.
Results: Among the 211 neonates observed, wound management was required in 10 cases of diaper dermatitis, 7 epidermal stripping, 6 extravasation injuries, 5 pressure ulcers, 1 surgical wound and infection, 1 thermal burn, and 5 other lesions.
Conclusions: International guidelines in neonatal wound care practice are not available, and further research concerns are clearly needed. Dressings and antiseptic agents should be chosen with great care for application to neonates, with particular attention to the prevention of adverse events in this sensitive population. Team work among dermatologists, neonatologists and nurses is crucial for the successful treatment of neonates."

The value of hydrogels in barrier creams has never been studied.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current technology in barrier cream formulation and explore the utility of hygrogels in skin protection.
Methods: A total of 80 men, women, and children between the ages of newborn to 80 years >were studied with the following dermatologic conditions: household hand dermatitis (21), occupational hand dermatitis (18), latex glove irritant contact dermatitis (9), diaper dermatitis (5), cutaneous wounds (17), and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) (10). In this study, the investigators used a split body approach, in a double-blind randomized fashion, where one body site was treated with a traditional petrolatum-based cream while the other body site was treated with a hydrogel-based barrier/repair cream. Both subject and investigator assessments were recorded by questionnaire.
Results: The hydrogel barrier/repair cream showed better skin improvement than the petrolatum-based cream in both subject assessment (62%, P =.0048) and investigator assessment (75%, P =.0000003).
Conclusion: Hydrogel barrier/repair creams might represent a new, effective approach to skin protection."
548,548,Incidence and Predictors of Incontinence-Associated Skin Damage in Nursing Home Residents With New-Onset Incontinence,2017,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Donna Z Bliss,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000313,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and predictors of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) in nursing home residents.
Methods: Records of a cohort of 10,713 elderly (â¥65 years) newly incontinent nursing home residents in 448 nursing homes in 28 states free of IAD were followed up for IAD development. Potential multilevel predictors of IAD were identified in 4 national datasets containing information about the characteristics of individual nursing home residents, nursing home care environment, and communities in which the nursing homes were located. A unique set of health practitioner orders provided information about IAD and the predictors of IAD prevention and pressure injuries in the extended perineal area. Analysis was based on hierarchical logistical regression.
Results: The incidence of IAD was 5.5%. Significant predictors of IAD were not receiving preventive interventions for IAD, presence of a perineal pressure injury, having greater functional limitations in activities of daily living, more perfusion problems, and lesser cognitive deficits.
Conclusion: Findings highlight the importance of prevention of IAD and treatment/prevention of pressure injuries. A WOC nurse offers expertise in these interventions and can educate staff about IAD predictors, which can improve resident outcomes. Other recommendations include implementing plans of care to improve functional status, treat perfusion problems, and provide assistance with incontinence and skin care to residents with milder as well as greater cognitive deficits."

The work comprised 1) a PU/Wound Audit (PUWA) and 2) a survey of PU monitoring systems. This second paper focusses on the survey which explores differences in the implementation of PU adverse event monitoring systems in 24 NHS hospital Trusts in England. The survey questionnaire comprised 41 items incorporating single and multiple response options and free-text items and was completed by the PUWA Trust lead in liaison with key people in the organisation. All 24 (100%) Trusts returned the questionnaire, with high levels of data completeness (99.1%). The questionnaire results showed variation between Trusts in relation to the recording of PUs and their reporting as part of NHS prevalence and incident monitoring systems and to Trust boards and healthcare commissioners including the inclusion (or not) of device ulcers, unstageable ulcers, Deep Tissue Injury, combined PUs/Incontinence Associated Dermatitis, category â¥ 1 ulcers or category â¥ 2 ulcers, inherited ulcers, acquired ulcers, avoidable and unavoidable ulcers and the definition of Present On Admission. These fundamental differences in reporting preclude Trust to Trust comparisons of PU prevalence and incident reporting and monitoring systems due to variation in local application and data collection methods. The results of this work and the PUWA led to the development of recommendations for PU monitoring practice, many of which are internationally relevant."
550,550,An Exploratory Study of Skin Problems Experienced by UK Nursing Home Residents Using Different Pad Designs,2015,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Sinead Clarke-OÊ¼Neill,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000177,"Purpose: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) among nursing home-based incontinence pad users varies between pad designs. A second aim was to examine the utility of a simple method for reporting skin health problems in which healthcare assistants were asked to record basic observational data at each pad change.
Study design: Randomized, multiple crossover, observational, exploratory.
Subjects and setting: Twenty-one men and 57 women using absorbent continence products to contain urinary and/or fecal incontinence were recruited from 10 nursing homes in London and the south of England.
Methods: A day-time variant and a night-time variant of each of the 4 main disposable pad designs on the market for moderate/heavy incontinence were tested: (1) insert pads with stretch pants; (2) 1-piece all-in-one diapers; (3) pull-up pants; and (4) belted/T-shape diapers. All pad variants for day-time use had an absorption capacity of 1900 mL Â± 20% (measured using ISO 11948-1 International Standards Organization) while the capacity of night-time variants was 2400 mL Â± 20%. Each resident used each of the 4 pad designs (day-time and night-time variants) for 2 weeks and the order of testing was randomized by nursing home. Skin health data were collected using 2 methods in parallel. Method 1 comprised visual observation by researchers (1 observation per pad design; 4 observations in total over 8 weeks). In method 2, healthcare assistants logged observational data on skin health at every pad change for the 8 weeks. The primary outcome variable was severity of the most severe skin problem noted by the researcher for each resident, and for each pad design (method 1). Descriptive data on skin care methods used in the nursing homes were also collected using short questionnaires and researcher observation.
Results: No significant differences in the severity or incidence of skin problems were found between observations using the 4 pad designs. However, a wide range of skin conditions was recorded that made classification difficult; the skin was often marked with creases from absorbent products, temporary marks, and pink/purple discoloration. We observed few cases of the severe erythema, rashes, and vesicles that are commonly used descriptors in previous skin tools. Nevertheless, the collected data reflect an abundance of skin problems that were difficult to categorize neatly. Researcher observations (method 1) showed that nearly all the residents (96%) had at least 1 IAD skin problem recorded over the 8-week period and 64% of residents had at least 1 problem that was rated as maximum severity. Healthcare assistants logged skin problems on 6.1% of pad changes. The discrepancy between researcher and healthcare assistant data appears to be largely due to healthcare assistants sometimes discounting low-grade IAD as normal for that population.
Conclusion: Incontinence-associated dermatitis is common among nursing home residents who use incontinence pads, and it is often severe. No evidence was found that any design of pad was more likely than any others to be associated with skin problems. The method devised to enable healthcare assistants to record basic observational data on skin health in the diaper area at each pad change (Method 2) proved simple to use but still resulted in substantial underreporting of IAD, suggesting that further work is needed to develop a tool that more successfully encourages them to log and treat IAD problems."
551,551,Developments in silicone technology for use in stoma care,2020,Br J Nurs,Thomas Swift,https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2020.29.6.s6,"Soft silicone's flexibility, adhesive capacity and non-toxic, non-odourous and hypoallergenic nature have made it an established material for adhesive and protective therapeutic devices. In wound care, silicone is a component of contact layer dressings for superficial wounds and silicone gel sheeting for reducing the risk of scarring, as well as of barriers for incontinence-associated dermatitis. Regarding stoma accessories, silicone is established in barrier films to prevent contact dermatitis, adhesive removers to prevent skin stripping and filler gels to prevent appliance leaks. Until recently, silicone has not been used in stoma appliances flanges, as its hydrophobic nature has not allowed for moisture management to permit trans-epidermal water loss and prevent maceration. Traditional hydrocolloid appliances manage moisture by absorbing water, but this can lead to saturation and moisture-associated skin damage (MASD), as well as increased adhesion and resultant skin tears on removal, known as medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI). However, novel silicone compounds have been developed with a distinct evaporation-based mechanism of moisture management. This uses colloidal separation to allow the passage of water vapour at a rate equivalent to normal trans-epidermal water loss. It has been shown to minimise MASD, increase wear time and permit atraumatic removal without the use of adhesive solvents. Trio Healthcare has introduced this technology with a range of silicone-based flange extenders and is working with the University of Bradford Centre for Skin Sciences on prototype silicone-based stoma appliance flanges designed to significantly reduce the incidence of peristomal skin complications, such as MARSI and MASD. It is hoped that this will also increase appliance wear time, reduce costs and improve patient quality of life."
552,552,Honey in dermatology and skin care: a review,2013,J Cosmet Dermatol,Bruno Burlando,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.12058,"Honey is a bee-derived, supersaturated solution composed mainly of fructose and glucose, and containing proteins and amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, minerals, and other minor components. Historical records of honey skin uses date back to the earliest civilizations, showing that honey has been frequently used as a binder or vehicle, but also for its therapeutic virtues. Antimicrobial properties are pivotal in dermatological applications, owing to enzymatic H2 O2 release or the presence of active components, like methylglyoxal in manuka, while medical-grade honey is also available. Honey is particularly suitable as a dressing for wounds and burns and has also been included in treatments against pityriasis, tinea, seborrhea, dandruff, diaper dermatitis, psoriasis, hemorrhoids, and anal fissure. In cosmetic formulations, it exerts emollient, humectant, soothing, and hair conditioning effects, keeps the skin juvenile and retards wrinkle formation, regulates pH and prevents pathogen infections. Honey-based cosmetic products include lip ointments, cleansing milks, hydrating creams, after sun, tonic lotions, shampoos, and conditioners. The used amounts range between 1 and 10%, but concentrations up to 70% can be reached by mixing with oils, gel, and emulsifiers, or polymer entrapment. Intermediate-moisture, dried, and chemically modified honeys are also used. Mechanisms of action on skin cells are deeply conditioned by the botanical sources and include antioxidant activity, the induction of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase expression, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition in wounded epidermis. Future achievements, throwing light on honey chemistry and pharmacological traits, will open the way to new therapeutic approaches and add considerable market value to the product."

In the clinical comparison with water and cleansing material, skin conditions were assessed visually for presence and severity of erythema and diaper dermatitis. The overall skin condition was not different in the group using wipes and in the group using only water and a cleansing material, indicating comparable skin mildness for both regimes. The chamber scarification test confirmed that the lotion contained in the wipe has a very low irritation potential, lower than that of a currently marketed baby wipe and comparable to that of water under occlusive patch test conditions. The good skin tolerance of the wipes was supported by the observations of a dermatologist in the clinical study in babies with atopic dermatitis. These data strongly support the suitability of the baby wipes tested in these studies for daily cleansing of the diapered area, even for infants with sensitive skin. These data also provide useful information regarding the comparative skin mildness of baby wipes and water."
554,554,[Study of the role of Candida albicans infection in different infant conditions including a diaper rash (64 cases)],1977,Ann Dermatol Venereol,F Desmons,,"The pathogenic role of Candida albicans has been determined by performing: skin scrapings, mouth swabs, faecal specimens and serology from 64 infants and very young children affected with different conditions including a napkin dermatitis, divided into 4 groups. 1) 7 patients affected with true or presumed candidiasis, 2) 53 patients with different manifestations of diaper dermatitis, 3) 3 patients with papulo-erosive dermatitis of the diaper area, 4) 1 congenital ichthosiform erythrodermia. Candida albicans is the only responsible agent of the granulomatous candidiasis, it is constant but appeared lately in acropathia enteropathica. It is one of the major agents of the trichophytoid dermatitis (2 cases out of 4 cases). Candida albicans has been recovered from the skin of 33 infants out of 53 patients affected with all types of napkin eruption (62 p. 100) and from faecal specimens of 43 patients (81 p. 100). Though Candida albicans has often been considered as an opportunistic organism, even in infants, this percentage is greatly higher than that of the normal infant that is about 4p. 100, and consequently has a real pathogenic value. Species of yeasts different from Candida albicans have been recovered from faecal specimens of 3 infants affected with papulo-erosive dermatitis of the napkin area: parapsilosis, macedoniensis, deformans which are not generally considered as pathogenic agents. Serology is positive only in 3 infants or young children affected with a real chronical candidosis: 1 granulomatous candidosis, 1 acropathia enteropathia, 1 erythrodermia, the faecal specimen of whom contained a great nomber of Candida albicans."

Recurrent candidosis is under debate as a contributor to preterm birth, and vertical transmission may cause diaper dermatitis and oral thrush in the newborn. Apart from cultural methods, the gold standard for diagnosing candidosis is Gram staining, which is time-consuming and requires laboratory facilities. The objective of this prospective study was to validate a point-of-care vaginal yeast detection assay (SavvyCheckâ¢ Vaginal Yeast Test) and to evaluate it in asymptomatic pregnant women. We enrolled 200 participants, 100 of whom had vulvovaginal candidosis according to Gram stain (study group) and 100 were healthy pregnant controls (control group). Of these, 22 participants (11%) had invalid test results. The point-of-care test of the remaining 85 and 93 study participants in the study and control groups, respectively, showed a sensitivity of 94.1%, specificity of 98.9%, positive predictive value of 90.3%, and negative predictive value of 99.4% when compared with Gram stain. In conclusion, we found a high correlation between the SavvyCheckâ¢ Vaginal Yeast Test and Gram-stained smears during pregnancy. This suggests a potential role of this point-of-care test as a screening tool for asymptomatic pregnant women in early gestation."

Specimens were obtained prior to therapy, within 3 days of conclusion of therapy, and 14-16 days later. Immediately following therapy, a decline in the number of bacterial isolates occurred on both the perineum (89 to 47) and sternum (84 to 39). The greatest decline occurred in the number of anaerobic bacteria (mostly Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes). Other organisms that were less often isolated were aerobic streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The number of Candida albicans isolates increased from 3 to 11 (p < 0.05) on the perineum, and 1 to 7 (p < 0.025) on the sternum. Four of the infants developed diaper dermatitis. The density of C. albicans increased more than 14-fold following amoxicillin therapy. Cultures done 14-16 days after cessation of therapy revealed an increase in the number of bacterial isolates on the perineum (47 to 72) and on the sternum (39 to 61) and a decline in recovery of C. albicans. This study demonstrates the effects of amoxicillin on the ecology of skin microbial flora in infants-a decrease in the number of bacterial isolates and an increase in recovery of C. albicans."
557,557,"Factors influencing intact skin in women with incontinence using absorbent products: results of a cross-sectional, comparative study",2010,Ostomy Wound Manage,Yoshie Shigeta,,"Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is a common problem in elderly incontinent people. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to examine and compare properties of intact skin on the buttocks and subumbilicus area in elderly people wearing absorbent products and to identify pad environment factors that affect skin properties. Study participants included 45 elderly (age range: 68 to 103 years) female residents of one nursing home who were incontinent of feces and urine (dual incontinence group--DIG, n = 35) or feces only (fecal incontinence group--FIG, n= 10). Skin pH and hydration were measured and factors believed to affect the perineal environment and contribute to the development of IAD were assessed. In both DIG and FIG, skin hydration levels and pH were higher in the coccygeal than in the subumbilical area. Skin hydration of the sacral region in the DIG was significantly higher than in the FIG (P = 0.019) and skin pH on the coccygeal region and sacral region in the DIG was significantly higher than in the FIG (coccygeal region, P = 0.013; sacral region, P = 0.023). Absorbent pad surface pH (P &0.01) and excessive sweating (P = 0.006) were significantly related to skin pH. Results show that properties of perineal skin in elderly women with incontinence are affected by occlusion with pads, increasing the risk of IAD. Studies comparing the effect of various types of pads and pad-change frequencies on skin properties are needed."
558,558,Prevalence of incontinence and associated skin injury in the acute care inpatient,2007,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Joan Junkin,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.won.0000270820.91694.1f,"Purpose: We examined the prevalence of incontinence and skin injury in areas exposed to incontinence among inpatients at 2 hospitals.
Subjects and setting: Acute care patients in medical, surgical, and intensive care units at a community and teaching hospital were surveyed to determine the rates of urinary and fecal incontinence and the prevalence of incontinence-associated dermatitis or skin ulceration.
Instrument: A data collection form that queried patient characteristics was completed. The presence of hypoalbuminemia (< or = 3.4 g/dL) and nutrition, friction and shear, and mobility status (using Braden scale scores) were also recorded. This instrument was designed by this research team and tested in a pilot study.
Results: A total of 608 patients age 4 years and older were surveyed. The overall prevalence of incontinence in the survey was 19.7% (120 of 608). One hundred seven patients (17.6%) were incontinent of stool. Fecal incontinence was more frequent than urinary incontinence overall, by gender and across the different age groups. However, 201 (33%) of the inpatients had indwelling urinary catheters and were counted as continent of urine. The highest prevalence of incontinence was found in the oldest age group (80+ years). Some type of injury to the skin was observed in 42.5% of the 120 patients who were incontinent. Hypoalbuminemia and poor nutritional status were more commonly noted in patients with skin injury associated with fecal incontinence.
Conclusion: Fecal and urinary incontinence are common among patients in the acute care setting. Fecal incontinence is associated with hypoalbuminemia and poor nutritional status and is associated with a higher rate of skin injury."
559,559,Physiological and appearance characteristics of skin maceration in elderly women with incontinence,2014,J Wound Care,Y Ichikawa-Shigeta,https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2014.23.1.18,"Objective: To identify the physiological and appearance characteristics of skin maceration caused by urine and/or faeces and determine their suitability as risk indicators for incontinence-associated dermatitis.
Method: This cross-sectional, comparative study involved sixty-nine elderly women with urinary and/or faecal incontinence who provided informed consent to participate. Exclusion criteria included serious medical problems, acute illness and the presence of damaged skin on the buttocks. The physiological and appearance characteristics of macerated skin on the buttocks of the patients were examined. Stratum corneum and dermis hydration levels, transepidermal water loss and skin pH were used to assess skin condition. Skin morphology (sulcus cutis) was confirmed using images at x15 magnification. The erythema index and white index were used to evaluate colour in the macerated skin areas.
Results: Forty-four patients exhibited skin maceration. Stratum corneum and dermis hydration levels were significantly greater in the maceration group than in the non-maceration group, as were transepidermal water loss, skin pH and differences in sulcus cutis interval between the buttock of interest and the subumbilical region. Furthermore, differences in the erythema and white indices between these two regions were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the maceration group than in the non-maceration group.
Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report to note that there are interesting changes not only in the epidermal layer but also in the dermis layer in patients with skin maceration. This finding confirmed that skin maceration caused by incontinence is a severe condition. Moreover, the erythema index was the best index for identifying skin maceration caused by incontinence, indicating that it can be used for precise and easy identification of the condition in clinical practice."

The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize empirical evidence about the efficacy and effectiveness of basic skin care interventions for maintaining skin integrity in the aged. The databases Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL (1990-2012), Scopus, SCI (February 2013) and reference lists were searched. Inclusion criteria were primary intervention studies using skin care products in physiologically aged skin (lower age limit 50 years). Study and sample characteristics, interventions and outcomes were extracted. The methodological quality was assessed and a level of evidence was assigned. From 1535 screened articles 188 were read in full text. From these, 33 articles were included reporting results on treating dry skin conditions, and preventing incontinence-associated dermatitis and superficial ulcerations. Most studies had lower levels of evidence of 3 or 4. Skin-cleansing products containing syndets or amphoteric surfactants compared with standard soap and water washing improved skin dryness and demonstrated skin-protecting effects. Moisturizers containing humectants consistently showed statistically significant improvements in skin dryness. Skin barrier products containing occlusives reduced the occurrence of skin injuries compared with standard or no treatment. Owing to methodological limitations the current evidence base for basic skin care in the aged is weak. Using low-irritating cleansing products and humectant- or occlusive-containing moisturizers seems to be the best strategy for maintaining the skin barrier function and integrity. We know little about the effects of cleansing regimens and about the benefits of moisturizers when compared with each other."

Yet, systematic reviews are lacking, and evidence-based topical and systemic treatment strategies remain unclear. Thus, the aim of this review was to summarize efficacy and adverse effects of topical and oral therapies for cutaneous candidiasis in all age groups. Two individual researchers searched PubMed and EMBASE for 'cutaneous candidiasis' and 'cutaneous candidiasis treatment', 'intertrigo', 'diaper dermatitis' and 'cheilitis'. Searches were limited to 'English language', 'clinical trials' and 'human subjects', and prospective clinical trials published in abstracts or articles were included. In total, 149 studies were identified, of which 44 were eligible, comprising 41 studies of 19 topical therapies and four studies of three systemic therapies for cutaneous candidiasis. Topical therapies were investigated in infants, children, adolescents, adults and elderly, while studies of systemic therapies were limited to adolescents and adults. Clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole were the most studied topical drugs and demonstrated similar efficacy with complete cure rates of 73%-100%. Single-drug therapy was as effective as combinations of antifungal, antibacterial and topical corticosteroid. Four studies investigated systemic therapy, and oral fluconazole demonstrated similar efficacy to oral ketoconazole and topical clotrimazole. Limitations to this review were mainly that heterogeneity of studies hindered meta-analyses. In conclusions, clotrimazole, nystatin and miconazole were the most studied topical drugs and demonstrated equal good efficacy and mild adverse effects similar to combinations of antifungal, antibacterial and topical corticosteroids. Oral fluconazole was as effective as topical clotrimazole and is the only commercially available evidence-based option for systemic treatment of cutaneous candidiasis."

Methodology: Design in 3 phases: 1) comprehensive review and critical appraisal of literature to design the preliminary content of the instrument; 2) critical evaluation of initial proposal by an expert group (nursing and pediatric medicine) with opinion survey and ad hoc questions; 3) content analysis using data tabulation for the modification and final design of the instrument.
Setting: Primary Care Management of Tenerife.
Results: In the 1st phase a proposed instrument is designed: two groups of risk factors (10 modulators risk and 9 high risk); and a severity scale with 5 aspects to assess including 4-5 items each (depth, location, extension, type of injury, signs of infection). The 2nd phase involved 19 professionals. A Tabulation of the data grouped into add or omit factors was used. The 3rd phase ends with a modified version of the instrument: 10 modulating factors, 5 of hig risk and 4 items for each aspect to assess severity.
Discussion-conclusions: The scarce bibliography found and absence of similar tools explain the design. The next phase will be the validation of RDIC-lac instrument.

This case highlights the rarity of poor weight gain in iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. A 17-month-old boy was referred to outpatients pediatric endocrine clinic for evaluation of growth failure. On presentation his weight was 9.7kg (5th percentile) and height was 72cm (-3.6 SD below mean for age and sex). Systemic examination revealed grossly moon-like face, hypertrichosis and thin skin in the genital area. His mother reported using local clobetasol for the previous seven months for his diaper dermatitis. Baseline plasma cortisol was low (0.3ng/ml, normal range: 60 to 280ng/ml). During standard dose of synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone test, the peak cortisol level was 0.4ng/ml (N>180ng/ml) and was consistent with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory investigations confirmed the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency and iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome. He was treated successfully by discontinuing use of clobetasol. His appearance and growth returned to normal within two months. Morning cortisol was 101.2ng/ml after stopping the oral physiologic dose of hydrocortisone. Our case differed from other reports of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome by presenting in poor weight gain rather than obesity."

Recently, MI alone, without MCI, has been increasingly used in consumer products in attempts to minimize allergic reactions. Wet wipes are extensively tested and traditionally believed to be innocuous. MI in wet wipes (""baby wipes"") has not been previously reported to cause ACD in children in the United States. Only 1 previous report of ACD in a child in Belgium has been recently reported. We report 6 children with chronic, perianal/buttock, and facial eczematous dermatitis, refractory to multiple topical and oral antibiotics and corticosteroids. All tested positive to MCI/MI on patch testing. None wore diapers. All patients had been using wet wipes containing MI (without MCI) to affected areas. Discontinuation of wipes resulted in rapid and complete resolution. This is the first report of pediatric ACD to MI in wet wipes in the United States, and the largest series to date. ACD to MI in wet wipes is frequently misdiagnosed as eczema, impetigo, or psoriasis. Wet wipes are increasingly marketed in personal care products for all ages, and MI exposure and sensitization will likely increase. Dermatitis of the perianal, buttock, facial, and hand areas with a history of wet wipe use should raise suspicion of ACD to MI and prompt appropriate patch testing. Rapid resolution occurs after the allergen exposure is eliminated. All isothiozolinones should be avoided in personal care and household products for these patients."
565,565,Dry skin in home care: A representative prevalence study,2018,J Tissue Viability,A Lichterfeld-Kottner,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtv.2018.07.001,"Aims and objectives: To measure the prevalence and severity of dry skin in the home care nursing setting in Germany and to determine demographic and health characteristics associated with skin dryness.
Background: Advanced age and skin care dependency are risk factors for the development of skin dryness. Dry skin has a negative impact on the quality of life and increases the risk for secondary cutaneous infections and other adverse skin conditions. The prevalence of dry skin in home care is unknown.
Design: A representative multicenter prevalence study was conducted in home care services in Germany during July 2015.
Methods: A random selection of home care services and clients was performed. Nurses, who were instructed how to perform the data collection using standardized forms, performed data collection. Demographic, functional and health variables were documented and analyzed.
Results: More than half of all participating clients (n = 923; median age 83 years (range 21-104)) were affected by dry skin (51.7 (95% CI 48.5 to 54.9). The most often affected skin areas were the distal extremities. Males and immobile clients were more often affected than females and mobile clients. In the adjusted analysis pruritus and the presence of incontinence-associated dermatitis were most strongly associated with dry skin.
Conclusion: Dry skin occurs widely in home care and is strongly associated with pruritus. Fundamental skin care is an easy but powerful nursing intervention to treat this condition successfully. Preventive skin care strategies need to be implemented in the home care setting to improve skin health and integrity either by nurses and/or informal caregivers."

Material and methods: The study, in the form of a questionnaire, spread on social media, was targeted at breastfeeding women. The questionnaire consisted of questions regarding the knowledge of non-nutritional usage of human milk, its use in practice, subjective opinion on the observed results and inclination towards future use. Chi-square tests and c-Pearson coefficients were used for statistical calculations.
Results: A total of 1187 responses were acted upon. In the study group, 879 women claimed to have knowledge of non-nutritional use of human milk in respect of skin and most common ailments, whilst 688 of them claimed to use at least one usage. The most frequently, breast milk was used for: care of cracked nipples, care of healthy skin, treatment of diaper dermatitis and treatment of neonatal acne. A correlation between duration of breastfeeding (p < 0.05) and gestational age (p < 0.05) and practical use of non-nutritional human milk was found.
Conclusions: The study showed a great enthusiasm of mothers in respect of using breast milk for non-nutritional purposes, including the treatment of skin diseases and other common ailments. However, given the scant studies determining possible concerns surrounding these methods, there is a requirement for parental education with emphasis on the need for prompt medical examination and pertinent treatment."

Methods: Data were analyzed from infants under 2 years of age with CFLS who had been transferred from general pediatricians. These 46 patients were divided into 2 groups (NFLS versus DIDN). Nocturnal stool was defined as evacuation between 10 pm and 6 am. Maximal stool amount/day (measured using the mother's hand) was specified as the highest score during the period of CFLS obtained by adding up each evacuation's score (range, 0-2 points).
Results: There were 36 cases of NFLS and 10 of DIDN. A failure to gain weight (P=0.0001), fever (P=0.0079), colic/abdominal pain (P=0.0014), gross blood in stool (except allergic proctocolitis) (P=0.0113), nocturnal stool (P=0.0001), and the score of stool amount (P=0.0001) were found to significantly differentiate the groups. A failure to gain weight was observed in 39% of even NFLS. The frequency, mucus content, and microbiological findings of stools, as well as diaper dermatitis were not found to significantly differentiate the groups.
Conclusion: NFLS was more common than DIDN in infants with CFLS. The most 'objective' differential factors were nocturnal stool and the score of stool amount (â¥7 points/day)."

The study was designed to investigate effects of honey, olive oil, and beeswax and the mixture on growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans isolated from human specimens.
Methods: The following experiments were performed: 1) honey mixture was poured on holes made on plates seeded with S. aureus or C. albicans, 2) the microorganisms were cultured onto media made of honey mixture alone, nutrient agar-honey mixture and Sabouraud glucose agar-honey mixture. The concentration of honey mixture in nutrient agar or Sabouraud glucose agar was 12.5, 25, 33, 50 and 66% (v/v), and 3) honey, olive oil or beeswax was added onto nutrient agar or Sabouraud glucose agar at a ratio of 1:2 (v/v) and then were seeded with S. aureus or C. albicans.
Results: Clear zone of inhibition was observed around holes filled with honey mixture; 3.5 mm on media seeded with C. albicans and 4 mm on media seeded with S. aureus. No growth of either microorganism was obtained on media made of honey mixture alone. The minimum concentration of honey mixture in nutrient agar-honey mixture media required to inhibit S. aureus was 50% and 66% concentration was required to inhibit C. albicans growth onto Sabouraud glucose agar-honey mixture media. No growth of S. aureus or C. albicans was obtained on media containing honey whereas mild to moderate growth was obtained on media containing olive oil or beeswax.
Conclusions: Honey and honey mixture apparently could inhibit growth of S. aureus or C. albicans."

Participants and setting: The Guideline was developed for nurses working on inpatient adult acute care units in a large community hospital in southwest Minnesota.
Approach: The Guideline was validated for its clarity and appropriateness by internal and external hospital-based wound care nurses and implemented through in-person rounding on the nursing units and distribution of badge cards and required completing an online education module. Surveys and wound documentation audits were conducted to measure changes in knowledge and skin care pre- and postimplementation of The Guideline.
Outcomes: We conducted wound documentation audits of approximately 491 records that assessed whether patients received appropriate treatment and found an improvement from 45% (104 of 231) to 80% (209 of 260). Nurses' self-rating of their knowledge about which dressings and topical treatment to use improved from 18% (16 of 89) agreement to 57% (55 of 96). Nurses' self-rating of their knowledge about when to change dressings and reapply topical treatments improved from 27% (24 of 89) agreement to 65% (62 of 96).
Implications for practice: Although there is evidence for a variety of dressings or products to treat wounds, this quality improvement project demonstrated increased adherence with providing appropriate care when fewer treatment options were recommended to nursing staff through our structured guideline. The Guideline continues to be used at the project site and is now being implemented at affiliate hospitals."

These personal hygiene and skin care activities are integral parts of nursing practice, but little is known about their benefits or clinical efficacy. The aim of this article was to summarize the empirical evidence supporting basic skin care procedures and interventions and to develop a clinical algorithm for basic skin care. Electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched and afterward a forward search was conducted using Scopus and Web of Science. In order to evaluate a broad range of basic skin care interventions systematic reviews, intervention studies, and guidelines, consensus statements and best practice standards also were included in the analysis. One hundred twenty-one articles were read in full text; 41documents were included in this report about skin care for prevention of dry skin, prevention of incontinence-associated dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries. The methodological quality of the included publications was variable. Review results and expert input were used to create a clinical algorithm for basic skin care. A 2-step approach is proposed including general and special skin care. Interventions focus primarily on skin that is either too dry or too moist. The target groups for the algorithm are adult patients or residents with intact or preclinical damaged skin in care settings. The goal of the skin care algorithm is a first attempt to provide guidance for practitioners to improve basic skin care in clinical settings in order to maintain or increase skin health."

Methods: Home-care patients with suspected functional constipation receiving nursing visits were recruited in this multiple-baseline, single-case experiment with intervention points shifted by 1 week. A total of 15 older adults were categorized into 3-, 4-, 5- or 6-week intervention phases. Ultrasonographic observations of fecal retention in the colorectum and defecation care based on observations during the ordinal physical assessment were reviewed. Tau-U was used for confirming the efficacy of the intervention by measuring the number of non-artificial and artificial defecations, as well as hard stools per week, and the amount of non-stimulant and stimulant laxatives, enemas and suppositories per week. For evaluating safety, adverse events, such as bowel obstruction and incontinence-associated dermatitis, were confirmed.
Results: No adverse events were observed. Statistical analysis showed that hard stools and artificial defecation reduced, and that their effect sizes were significant (Tau = -0.48, P < 0.01; Tau = -0.53, P < 0.01). Even the amounts of stimulant laxative and glycerin enema reduced, and their effect sizes were significant (Tau = -0.56, P < 0.01; Tau = -0.34, P = 0.04).
Conclusions: Thus, defecation care based on ultrasonographic assessment by nurses in home-care settings is safe and effective for improving constipation symptoms and reducing laxative use. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; â¢â¢: â¢â¢-â¢â¢."
572,572,Economic Model for Cost Containment: Evaluating the Utilization of a Touch-free Zinc Oxide in an Acute Care Hospital,2019,Cureus,Ana Clara Tolentino,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.4957,"Introduction Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), the most common form of moisture-associated skin damage (MASD), puts patients at higher risk for ulceration. Treatment of MASD/IAD includes application of zinc oxide, typically applied using gloved hands directly to the area of concern. A computational model was utilized to examine a cost comparison of a touch-free zinc oxide treatment versus traditional zinc oxide for MASD/IAD. Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed, a nursing journal database (CINAHL), and MEDLINE for publications from January 1, 2010 through November 30, 2017. Data on prevalence of MASD/IAD, average length of stay, and time to heal were extracted and utilized in the computational model. Cost per patient stay and annual total hospital costs were calculated for three and four applications of zinc oxide per patient with an averaged prevalence rate of 25% for a hypothetical hospital. Results The computational model estimated a range of cost savings between $181.88 to $2,000.63 per patient stay, and $4,728.88 to $52,016.25 over a 12-month period compared to traditional zinc oxide application. Conclusions The computational model estimated a cost savings of up to $52,016.25 per year in a hypothetical 250-bed acute care hospital compared to traditional zinc oxide application. Future prospective studies examining clinical effectiveness and health economics of touch-free zinc oxide are necessary."
573,573,Improving newborn skin health: Effects of diaper care regimens on skin pH and erythema,2021,Pediatr Dermatol,Jennifer Gustin,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14602,"Background/objective: Newborn infant skin is functional but immature, and diapering products can play a significant role in infant diapered skin health. Previous work demonstrated a regimen consisting of a diaper with an emollient and apertures on the inner liner (topsheet) with an acidic, pH-buffered wipe (Regimen A) lowered newborn skin pH and reduced the enzymatic activity on skin post-stool cleaning versus a regimen without these features (Regimen B). This study extends these findings to determine the impact of Regimen A on diaper area erythema severity over a 2-week use period.
Methods: This IRB-approved, blinded, randomized, crossover study enrolled newborn infants >7 days and â¤8 weeks. Participants exclusively used two unique diaper and wipe combinations, Regimen A and Regimen B (non-emollient, non-aperture containing topsheet and wipe with limited buffering capacity), each for 14 days and preceded by a 3-day washout regimen.
Results: Diapered skin pH was reduced during Regimen A use to values similar to that of a non-diapered control site (chest), while use of Regimen B was associated with a more alkaline skin pH. Regimen A resulted in significantly fewer severe erythema episodes. At the site of highest erythema, the perianal space, the average erythema score was significantly lower and more newborns were free of erythema while using Regimen A vs. Regimen B (P < .05).
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that diapering products can have a significant impact on newborn skin. They reinforce the need to support the physiological normalization of skin pH and protection from skin irritation and damage."
574,574,The influence of incontinence on the characteristic properties of the skin in bedridden elderly subjects,2016,Int J Dermatol,Tsutomu Fujimura,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.13170,"Background: The mechanisms of skin breakdown induced by incontinence have been proposed from a variety of experimental studies. However, studies on the influence of skin properties caused by incontinence of bedridden subjects are very limited.
Objective: This work was conducted to reveal how incontinence influences skin properties by comparing bedridden incontinent elderly subjects with age-matched healthy continent elderly and middle-aged subjects.
Methods: Bedridden incontinent elderly subjects (n = 35, 83.5 Â± 9.7 years, mean age Â± SD), healthy continent elderly (n = 41, 75.9 Â± 5.6 years), and middle-aged (n = 20, 41.3 Â± 2.8 years) were recruited for this study. Skin surface pH, capacitance/hydration, transepidermal water loss, and bacteria on forearm and buttock skin were measured.
Results: Hydration and transepidermal water loss values between healthy elderly subjects and incontinent elderly subjects were significantly different on buttock skin. Significant differences between those two groups were also observed regarding pH and total bacteria levels on buttock skin. The forearm skin showed no significant difference in these parameters. No significant influence was observed between with and without urination at the measurement time except for the pH of buttock skin. No significant correlation was observed except between pH and bacteria levels on buttock skin of incontinent elderly subjects.
Conclusion: In this study, we clarified the characteristic features of skin induced by incontinence. Our results indicate that these parameters are adequate not only to evaluate the characteristic skin features of bedridden incontinent subjects but also to develop new diapers to avoid the diaper dermatitis caused by incontinence."
575,575,Hamamelis in children with skin disorders and skin injuries: results of an observational study,2007,Eur J Pediatr,Helmut H Wolff,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-006-0363-1,"Published clinical experience with hamamelis ointment in children is limited. This observational study included children (age 27 days to 11 years) with minor skin injuries, diaper dermatitis, or localized inflammation of skin. The children received either hamamelis ointment or dexpanthenol ointment in groups at a 3-to-1 ratio. Baseline and post-treatment assessments compared the total scores of predefined signs and symptoms for each condition. Physicians and parents were asked for a global assessment of efficacy and tolerability of the respective treatments at the end of therapy. A total of 309 children were treated (hamamelis n = 231; dexpanthenol n = 78). The treatment groups were comparable regarding demographic data and baseline total scores of signs and symptoms. In all three diagnosis groups, the efficacy of hamamelis and dexpanthenol was shown by a statistically significant and clinically relevant decrease of total scores from baseline to endpoint (p < 0.0001 for each group, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Overall, the results for the hamamelis and the dexpanthenol groups were similar. Descriptive advantages for the hamamelis group were observed for a number of parameters and diagnosis groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Ratings of the tolerability of hamamelis were ""excellent"" or ""good"" in 99.1% (physicians) and 98.2% (parents) of cases, respectively. The corresponding ratings for dexpanthenol were 97.4 and 92.3%. In conclusion, hamamelis ointment is an effective and safe treatment for certain skin disorders in children up to the age of 11 years. The observed effects are similar to dexpanthenol."

The aim was to review the clinical and laboratory findings of patients with ICS and to investigate other serious side effects.
Methods: The possibility of AI was investigated by low-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone test. Hydrocortisone was started in patients with adrenal failure.
Results: Fourteen patients (five boys) with ages ranging from 0.19 to 11.89 years were included. The duration of GC exposure ranged from 1 to 72 months. Ten patients were prescribed topical GC and the rest had oral exposure. Moon face and abdominal obesity were detected in all patients. At presentation, 12 of 14 had AI and two infants had hypercalcemia and nephrocalcinosis. Of 11 patients, ultrasonography revealed hepatosteatosis in five. A cream for diaper dermatitis was used in one infant and the active ingredient was listed as panthenol. However, blood and urine steroid analyses revealed that all endogenous steroids were suppressed. Median (range) time to normalization of HPA axis function was 60 (30-780) days.
Conclusion: The majority (85%) of patients had life-threatening AI and two patients had hypercalcemia. These results highlight the serious side-effects of inappropriate use of potent GCs, especially in infants. The recovery of the HPA axis in children might take as long as three years. Parents should be informed regarding the possibility of some products containing unlisted synthetic GC and to be aware of their side effects."
577,577,Infantile eczema at one month of age is associated with cord blood eosinophilia and subsequent development of atopic dermatitis and wheezing illness until two years of age,2005,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,Kenji Matsumoto,https://doi.org/10.1159/000085435,"Background: Physiological and pathological skin eruptions are commonly encountered in neonates in our clinical practice. However, the types of skin eruptions that are associated with the subsequent development of atopic dermatitis and the mechanisms of these associations remain uncertain.
Methods: A total of 105 newborn babies with normal delivery were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. The cord blood eosinophil count was measured and the neonates were examined at 1 month of age and followed until 8 years of age.
Results: At 1 month of age, infantile eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, intertrigo and diaper dermatitis were diagnosed in a total of 29, 7, 14 and 24 neonates, respectively. No association was found among the prevalences of these eruptions. Neonates with infantile eczema had a significantly higher number and ratio of eosinophils in the cord blood (eosinophil count: 670.8 +/- 67.8 vs. 349.0 +/- 30.3/microl, p < 0.0001; eosinophil ratio: 5.12 +/- 0.53 vs. 2.61 +/- 0.22%, p < 0.0001, for the presence and the absence of infantile eczema, respectively). In contrast, no such tendency was found for any other skin eruptions. In neonates with infantile eczema at 1 month of age, the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis had been made significantly earlier and the prevalence of wheezing illness was significantly higher than in those without infantile eczema until 2 years of age.
Conclusion: Infantile eczema, but not other skin eruptions, precedes the development of atopic dermatitis and wheezing illness during early infancy, presumably because of the activation of eosinophils before birth."

Three Chinese electronic databases and two English electronic databases were searched for pharmacological and clinical studies on pine pollen. Data were extracted and analyzed and included publication year, authors, study type, pharmacological research topics or clinical diseases/conditions, usage and type of preparation, authors' conclusions, and adverse effects. Of 239 publications identified, 180 were pharmacological studies, 37 were clinical trials, and 22 were reviews. Numbers of publications increased particularly from 2004 onward. The top 10 most frequent topics in pharmacological studies were immune regulation, antisenility, antioxidation, liver protection, inhibiting prostate hyperplasia, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, lowering blood glucose, lowering blood lipids, antifatigue, and improving intestinal function. The top 10 most frequent clinical diseases treated or where pine pollen was used as an adjuvant were bedsores, diaper dermatitis, hyperlipidemia, oral mucositis, eczema, hyperplasia of prostate, hypertension, prostatitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and radiodermatitis. Eight trials reported no adverse events associated with pine pollen, one reported mild gastrointestinal reactions, but symptoms disappeared without special management. There have been an increasing number of publications on pine pollen during the past 20 years. Pharmacological studies have shown many potential benefits, and clinical studies have indicated some positive effects when it is either used as a single herb or as an adjuvant to treat disease. Its use as a topical agent, especially for skin diseases, was notable."
579,579,Effect of diaper cream and wet wipes on skin barrier properties in infants: a prospective randomized controlled trial,2014,Pediatr Dermatol,Natalie Garcia Bartels,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.12370,"The effect of different diaper care procedures on skin barrier function in infants has been minimally investigated and may be assessed using objective methods. In a single-center, prospective trial, 89 healthy 9-month-old infants (Â±8 wks) were randomly assigned to three diaper care regimens: group I used water-moistened washcloths at diaper changes (n = 30), group II additionally applied diaper cream twice daily (n = 28), and group III used wet wipes and diaper cream twice daily (n = 31). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration (SCH), skin pH, interleukin 1Î± (IL-1Î±) levels, and microbiologic colonization were measured in diapered skin (upper outer quadrant of the buttocks), nondiapered skin (upper leg), and if diaper dermatitis (DD) occurred, using the most affected skin area at day 1 and weeks 4 and 8. Skin condition was assessed utilizing a neonatal skin condition score and diaper rash grade. On diapered skin, SCH decreased in groups II and III, whereas TEWL values were reduced in group II only. Skin pH increased in groups II and III. In general, SCH, skin pH, and IL-1Î± levels were higher in healthy diapered skin than in nondiapered skin. The incidence and course of DD was comparable in all groups. Areas with DD had greater TEWL and skin pH than unaffected skin areas. Infants who received diaper cream had lower SCH and TEWL and higher pH levels in the diapered area than on nondiapered skin. No correlation with the occurrence of DD was found."

In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the frequency of mucocutaneous changes (particularly hyperpigmentation) seen during vitamin B12 deficiency and resolving time of these symptoms with vitamin B12 treatment.
Material and methods: This prospective study was conducted at the pediatrics outpatient clinic of Harran and Yuzuncu Yil University Faculty of Medicine, among 57 patients, aged between 6 and 24 months, who were diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency following various examinations and tests. A detailed examination was performed in respect to skin and mucosal findings. Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency were administered intramuscular cyanocobalamin. Prospective examination was continued, and resolving time of symptoms after treatment was recorded.
Results: The mean age of the patients enrolled in the study was found to be 12.75 Â± 4.75. Hyperpigmentation was reported in 49 (85.96%) patients enrolled in the study; atrophic glossitis in 40 (70.17%), brittle and matt hair in 13 (22.80%), skin lesions (particularly diaper dermatitis) in eight (15.78%) and cheilosis in four (7.01%) patients. Three months after the treatment initiation, hyperpigmentation improved in 87.75%, atrophic glossitis in 97.5% and brittle and matt hair in 92.3% of the patients. Five patients (8.77%) with continuing pigmentation by the end of sixth months were considered as nonresponsive to the treatment.
Conclusion: Deficiency of vitamin B12 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infants who present with skin and mucosal lesions."
581,581,PROTECT - trial: a multicentre prospective pragmatic RCT and health economic analysis of the effect of tailored repositioning to prevent pressure ulcers - study protocol,2017,J Adv Nurs,Dorien De Meyer,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.13166,"Aim: The aims of this trial were as follows: (1) to compare the (cost-) effectiveness of a turning and repositioning system and an algorithm for a tailored repositioning vs. usual care to improve reposition frequency in patients at risk; and (2) to compare the (cost-) effectiveness of standardized incontinence care vs. usual care.
Background: Pressure ulcers are a serious and common problem for hospitalized patients. In many countries, pressure ulcers are recognized as a national health issue and governments designate pressure ulcers as one of the most important sentinel events for health care. International guidelines recommend the use of pressure redistributing support surfaces, systematic patient repositioning and preventive skin care to prevent pressure ulcers. Interventions should be patient-tailored and based on a thorough assessment of both the patient and contextual risk factors. There is a lack of rigorous research addressing the effectiveness of a turning and repositioning system and it is unclear how to tailor the frequency and posture to specific patient needs.
Design: Multicentre, cluster, three-arm, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The ward is the unit of randomization.
Methods: Tailored repositioning, the use of a device to facilitate patient repositioning and an optimal procedure for incontinence care will be combined. Participating wards will be intensive care units, geriatric and rehabilitation wards. A sample size calculation was performed (80% power, Î± = 0Â·05). This study is approved by the Ethics Committee (February 2016).
Discussion: Data collection is currently ongoing. The results are expected to be obtained in March 2017."
582,582,In vivo methods to evaluate a new skin protectant for loss of skin integrity,2016,Wound Repair Regen,Raha A Been,https://doi.org/10.1111/wrr.12455,"A new skin protectant was developed for use on conditions involving partial-thickness skin loss such as severe incontinence-associated dermatitis. This new formulation is based on a cyanoacrylate chemistry designed to polymerize in situ and create a breathable film able to protect the skin surface from external irritants. This film provides an environment favorable for healing to occur beneath the film. To evaluate the characteristics of the novel chemistry, we devised a preclinical testing strategy comprising three different animal models. The data from all three models was considered collectively to create an overall assessment of effectiveness. A guinea pig model was used to evaluate the barrier efficacy of the new product in protecting intact skin from irritation. A porcine partial-thickness wound model was used to evaluate the efficacy of the product in helping control minor bleeding and exudate. A similar model was also used to assess the process of reepithelialization in the continued presence of an irritant. In the first model, untreated sites had 8.5 times more irritation than sites covered with the new product (p < 0.001). In the second model, a single application of the new product successfully attached to intact peri-wound skin and to denuded, weepy skin. It significantly reduced the amount of fluid weeping from the wounds (p â¤ 0.001) and continued to perform throughout a 96 hours experiment. In the third model, the percent of reepithelialization was significantly greater for the wounds covered with the new product than for the control wounds (p = 0.003; on average, 18.3% greater, with a 95% confidence interval of 9.2% to 27.5%). These results suggest that the new skin protectant protects intact and denuded skin from irritants and provides an environment favorable to healing, offering promise for the management of various conditions involving loss of epidermis."
583,583,Durability of an Advanced Skin Protectant Compared With Other Commercially Available Products in Healthy Human Volunteers,2018,Wounds,Mircea Muresan,,"Background: A new skin protectant with improved adhesion to denuded skin and resistance to wash off has been developed to protect skin from incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) or general loss of skin integrity.
Objective: This controlled, randomized, prospective, open-label study determines the durability of the new protectant when applied to intact skin in 21 healthy human volunteers and compares it to 3 other products used for similar clinical indications.
Materials and methods: Eight 0.75-in circles of black carbon pigment were applied to the bilateral forearms (4 per arm to allow for duplicates) of the participants and covered with the various products. Participants conducted normal routine activities over 7 days. Photographs were taken and a test site assessment was completed before and after application of the products on day 0 and at days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 to evaluate pigment loss over time. Carbon integrated optical density (CIOD) was measured under the assumption that a loss of pigment correlated with a loss of the protective product. These data were used to calculate the percent barrier remaining over time.
Results: The percent of intact film was significantly greater (P < .05) from day 3 onwards for the new skin protectant compared with the other 3 products. The new product showed no significant change in CIOD (P = .46) from day 1 through day 7, indicating no meaningful wear over time. The other 3 products showed significant changes in CIOD (P < .01) beginning at either day 2 or day 3.
Conclusions: The new skin protectant was more durable than the other products tested. It remained in place for up to 7 days for all participants, whereas the other products had < 50% remaining on the skin by that time point."
584,584,The Skin Safety Model: Reconceptualizing Skin Vulnerability in Older Patients,2016,J Nurs Scholarsh,Jill L Campbell,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12176,"Purpose: To develop a unique skin safety model (SSM) that offers a new and unified perspective on the diverse yet interconnected antecedents that contribute to a spectrum of potential iatrogenic skin injuries in older hospitalized adults.
Organizing construct: Discussion paper.
Methods: A literature search of electronic databases was conducted for published articles written in English addressing skin integrity and iatrogenic skin injury in elderly hospital patients between 1960 and 2014.
Findings: There is a multiplicity of literature outlining the etiology, prevention, and management of specific iatrogenic skin injuries. Complex and interrelated factors contribute to iatrogenic skin injury in the older adult, including multiple comorbidities, factors influencing healthcare delivery, and acute situational stressors. A range of injuries can result when these factors are complicated by skin irritants, pressure, shear, or friction; however, despite skin injuries sharing multiple antecedents, no unified overarching skin safety conceptual model has been published.
Conclusions: The SSM presented in this article offers a new, unified framework that encompasses the spectrum of antecedents to skin vulnerability as well as the spectrum of iatrogenic skin injuries that may be sustained by older acute care patients. Current skin integrity frameworks address prevention and management of specific skin injuries. In contrast, the SSM recognizes the complex interplay of patient and system factors that may result in a range of iatrogenic skin injuries. Skin safety is reconceptualized into a single model that has the potential for application at the individual patient level, as well as healthcare systems and governance levels.
Clinical relevance: Skin safety is concerned with keeping skin safe from any iatrogenic skin injury, and remains an ongoing challenge for healthcare providers. A conceptual framework that encompasses all of the factors that may contribute to a range of iatrogenic skin injuries is essential, and guides the clinician in maintaining skin integrity in the vulnerable older patient."
585,585,Comparing the effectiveness and wash-off resistance of skin barrier creams: a healthy volunteer study,2017,J Wound Care,P Dykes,https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2017.26.9.552,"Objective: Preventing moisture damage and breakdown of the skin can be a particular challenge for patients with incontinence. The level of protection offered by various skin protectant products can vary according to the chemical nature of the formulation and can decrease following wash procedures. The aim of this study was to compare five silicone-containing skin barrier creams indicated for use on incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) in terms of their resistance to a standardised wash cycle in healthy volunteer subjects.
Method: A skin surface hygrometer (Skicon 200EX) evaluated skin surface conduction non-invasively on 36 non-patient subjects using a high-frequency (3.5MHz) electric current. This provided an index of the degree of protection given by barrier products after a single application and also any reduction in barrier properties after a repeated wash procedure.
Results: Medi Derma-S barrier cream (MDS), Cavilon barrier cream (CBC) and LBF barrier cream (LBF) all demonstrated statistically significant differences (p<0.001) in the Skicon values following the first moisture challenge compared with Medihoney (MH), Remedy barrier cream (RBC) and the untreated control. All other comparisons were not significant (p>0.05). Statistical analysis following four moisture challenges reflected the results following the first, whereby Skicon values following treatment with MDS, CBC and LBF was significantly different compared with MH, RBC and the untreated control. Again, all other comparisons were not significant (p>0.05). When expressed as percentage barrier effectiveness, the results show a similar pattern to the absolute Skicon values.
Conclusion: The results of this study show that there were differences between the barrier creams in terms of the initial moisture challenge and the resistance to wash-off following a repeated standardised wash procedure. It was concluded that MDS, CBC and LBF barrier cream all showed significant and equally effective moisture barrier protection and wash-off resistance."

Methods: This phase 2, randomized, open, controlled trial conducted in Ghana, Tanzania, and Gabon evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS01(E) when coadministered with EPI vaccines. Five hundred eleven infants were randomized to receive RTS,S/AS01(E) at 0, 1, and 2 months (in 3 doses with diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis conjugate [DTPw]; hepatitis B [HepB]; Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib]; and oral polio vaccine [OPV]), RTS,S/AS01(E) at 0, 1, and 7 months (2 doses with DTPwHepB/Hib+OPV and 1 dose with measles and yellow fever), or EPI vaccines only.
Results: The occurrences of serious adverse events were balanced across groups; none were vaccine-related. One child from the control group died. Mild to moderate fever and diaper dermatitis occurred more frequently in the RTS,S/AS01(E) coadministration groups. RTS,S/AS01(E) generated high anti-circumsporozoite protein and anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels. Regarding EPI vaccine responses upon coadministration when considering both immunization schedules, despite a tendency toward lower geometric mean titers to some EPI antigens, predefined noninferiority criteria were met for all EPI antigens except for polio 3 when EPI vaccines were given with RTS,S/AS01(E) at 0, 1, and 2 months. However, when antibody levels at screening were taken into account, the rates of response to polio 3 antigens were comparable between groups.
Conclusion: RTS,S/AS01(E) integrated in the EPI showed a favorable safety and immunogenicity evaluation. Trial registration. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00436007 . GlaxoSmithKline study ID number: 106369 (Malaria-050)."
587,587,Perineal Skin Cleansers for Adults with Urine Incontinence in Long-Term Care or Hospital Settings: A Review of the Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines [Internet],,,Chantelle C. Lachance,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk551869/,"Urinary incontinence, defined as involuntary leakage of urine, is a prevalent condition affecting approximately 3.5 million Canadians., Though male and female incontinence may differ in terms of their etiology, clinical manifestations, and treatments, all patients with urinary incontinence can experience physical, psychological, and economic burdens as a result of their condition (e.g., reduced participation in activities, lower quality of life, purchasing incontinence-related garments)., When an individual with urinary incontinence resides in long-term care or is admitted to hospital, they may also be at an increased risk of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD, perineal dermatitis). IAD is a type of irritant contact dermatitis seen in patients with incontinence, generally caused by prolonged exposure to moisture, and clinically presents as inflammation and/or redness of the perineal or perigenital skin; swelling and blister formation may be present in more severe cases., IAD is particularly more prevalent for adults staying in long-term care and in hospital because patients are often older, less mobile, and may require assistance to clean soiled garments.
In long-term care and hospital settings, perineal skin cleanser products may be used for patients with urine incontinence. Cleanser products aim to clean the perineum area, removing skin irritants (urine, fecal matter). Some skin cleansers available for purchase advertise as being pH-balanced to minimize irritation and can be a non-rinse formula with the goal of improving usability and efficiency for care staff., Despite being used in the health care setting, it is unclear if these cleansers are more clinically effective than standard care (e.g., soap and water) for the the management for urinary incontinence. A review of the evidence is necessary to inform future purchase and policy decision-making.
Therefore, the aim of this report is to summarize the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of the use of perineal skin cleanser products for patients with urine incontinence in long-term care and hospital settings. Evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of perineal skin cleanser products for patients with urine incontinence in long-term care and hospital settings will also be examined."
588,588,Effect of a structured skin care regimen on patients with fecal incontinence: a comparison cohort study,2014,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Kyung Hee Park,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000005,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of a structured skin care regimen for critically ill patients with fecal incontinence.
Design: A nonrandomized, quasi-experimental research design (comparison cohort) was used for data collection.
Subjects and setting: Seventy-six patients with fecal incontinence, Bristol stool form 5, 6, and 7, and Braden Scale score of 16 or less in the intensive care units (ICUs) at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea, participated in the study.
Methods: Of the 76 subjects enrolled, 38 were assigned to the experimental group and 38 to the control group. Participants in the active intervention group were being cared for in an ICU; participants in the comparison group were cared for on cardiac, thoracic surgery, general surgery, and neurosurgical ICUs. A structured skin care regimen was developed and implemented, which included the regular use of a no-rinse skin cleanser, application of a skin protectant, and an indwelling fecal drainage system when indicated. Stool consistency was evaluated via the Bristol stool chart. Nurses trained in data collection determined Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis and its Severity (IADS) scores and assessed the perianal and sacral skin for occurrence of pressure ulcers daily over a 7-day period.
Results: Patients in the intervention group had significantly lower IADS scores (t = 4.836, P < .001) than subjects in the control group and were less likely to develop a pressure ulcer than were patients in the control group (5 vs. 19, Ï2 = 11.936, P = .001). Patients with higher IADS scores were significantly more likely to develop a pressure ulcer (OR = 1.168, 95% CI = 1.074-1.271).
Conclusion: A structured skin care regimen decreased IADS scores and occurrence of pressure ulcers. Higher IADS scores were associated with an increased risk for development of pressure ulcers."
589,589,Benchmarking to the international pressure ulcer prevalence survey,2011,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Sharon House,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0b013e318215fa48,"Purpose: Authors and team members from the naval medical center at portsmouth (NMCP), virginia, obtained data on the prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers (PUs) in our agency and compared them to national benchmark data as a basis for improving our wound care protocols.
Subjects and setting: health care facilities throughout the nation volunteered to participate in the data collection process for a multiday PU prevalence survey performed in february 2009, including nmcp. Each facility collected prevalence data during a preselected 24-hour period out of the 72-hour time frame selected by the national study.
Methods: A standardized 1-page data collection form for each subject included demographic data, use of wound care protocols and pressure redistribution surfaces, PU stage and location, risk assessment using the braden scale for pressure sore risk, head-of-bed position, turning and repositioning, mobility, weight, incontinence, documentation of a PU within 24 hours of admission, device-related ulcers, and adequacy of documentation. Facility-specific data on a second form included braden scale score, bed type, use of pressure redistribution devices on the heels, hospital unit, turn schedule use, plastic brief use, presence of incontinence-associated dermatitis, and nursing documentation. Chart reviews were performed to determine hospital- versus non-hospital-acquired PU occurrence. Each PU was recorded separately and linked to its identifying stage.
Results: The PU incidence of adults managed in acute care inpatient units at NMCP was 6.6% and the prevalence was 10%. The most common location of facility-acquired PUs was the heels (50%). In contrast, national benchmarking data found that the highest incidence of PUs occurred in the sacral region.
Conclusions: Benchmarking allows health care professionals to compare outcomes in their agencies to outcomes in comparable facilities. Identification of areas in which agency outcomes compare negatively to benchmark data should prompt implementation of quality improvement initiatives. National PU prevalence surveys provide a benchmark to evaluate an individual facility's care and treatment of patients at risk for pressure ulceration. The true benefit of participation in such surveys, however, is determined by local health care professionals' ability to use national data to improve clinical practice."
590,590,Use of an absorbent dressing specifically for fecal incontinence,2008,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Donna Z Bliss,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.won.0000313647.44870.9a,"Purpose: Use of an absorbent product is a self-care strategy for managing fecal incontinence that protects against visible soiling. The purpose of this study was to examine use of a small surgical dressing that can be placed between the buttocks to absorb leaked feces.
Design: Cross-sectional survey.
Subjects and setting: A survey was mailed to 75 randomly selected community-living people in 25 states and the District of Columbia, who ordered the dressing more than once within the past year. Thirty-six people (age = 55 +/- 16 years mean +/- SD), 57% men and 94% white responded.
Instrument: A 48-question survey that included questions asked about demographics and general health, emotional states (eg, anxiety and depression), bowel pattern and incontinence, quality of life, and use of an anorectal dressing was developed for this study. The survey also contained 2 tools, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life instrument. The Fecal Incontinence Severity Index is a tool that enables valid assessment of fecal incontinence severity using patient recall of symptoms of frequency and type of bowel leakage. The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life instrument results in a valid and reliable evaluation of fecal incontinence-specific quality of life using 4 domains of lifestyle, coping/behavior, depression/self-perception, and embarrassment.
Results: The fecal incontinence severity score was 28 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD); 79% leaked loose/liquid feces, 50% leaked daily, and leaked feces remained between the buttocks in 64%; 21% also leaked urine. Eighty-five percent experienced incontinence-associated dermatitis. Of those who used the dressing, 50% were men. The anorectal dressing was preferred to a pad by 92%, prevented soiling in 88%, and its ability to stay in place was rated very good or good by 76%. Eighty percent of respondents rated the dressing's comfort very good or good; 85% rated its overall effectiveness very good or good. Use of the dressing lessened anxiety about fecal soiling in 81% and was thought to improve quality of life in 76%.
Conclusion: An anorectal dressing offers an effective, comfortable alternative to a pad for absorbing leaked feces that seems acceptable to men."
591,591,An economic evaluation of four skin damage prevention regimens in nursing home residents with incontinence: economics of skin damage prevention,2007,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Donna Z Bliss,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.won.0000264825.03485.40,"Purpose: To determine the cost and efficacy of 4 different regimens of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) prevention in nursing home residents.
Methods: A multi-site open-label quasi-experimental study was conducted in 16 nursing homes stratified by location in 1 of 4 regions of the United States and randomly selected. In 3 of the 4 regimens, a moisture barrier ointment or cream of different compositions was applied after each episode of incontinence, and in 1 regimen, a polymer-based barrier film was applied 3 times per week. All regimens used a pH-balanced moisturizing cleanser. Time and motion measures were documented for the amount of skin care products used; the number, type, and time of caregivers performing IAD prevention care; and the number and type of supplies used. Rates of incontinence in each nursing home were determined during a 3-day surveillance period.
Results: A total of 1,918 nursing home residents were screened, and 51% (n = 981) qualified for prospective surveillance of incontinence dermatitis; the majority were female (80.1%) and elderly (96% > or = 65 years old). A total of 78.6% (771/981) of the participants were incontinent of both urine and feces. Compared to the 3 regimens in which a barrier was applied after each episode of incontinence, the use of a regimen in which a barrier film was applied 3 times weekly had significantly lower costs for the barrier product, labor associated with barrier application, and total cost, which included products, labor, and supplies. There were also savings in total product (cleanser and barrier) and total labor costs.
Conclusions: The use of a defined skin care regimen that includes a cleanser and a moisture barrier is associated with a low rate of IAD in nursing home residents who are incontinent. Use of a polymer skin barrier film 3 times weekly is effective for preventing incontinence-associated skin breakdown and can provide significant cost savings."

Although these skin toxicities are well described in adults, studies of pediatric oncology patients are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cutaneous findings in pediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy.
Methods: In this prospective cohort study conducted from December 2018 to March 2020, all pediatric oncology patients were examined and patients who had a dermatologic finding at any point during their treatments were recorded. Dermatologic examinations were performed by the same dermatologists, and biopsy and microbiologic tests were performed according to clinical need. Patients were grouped according to their oncologic diagnoses and types of chemotherapies.
Results: A total of 80 patients with a mean age of 9.1 Â± 5.0 years were included in the study. Seventy-five (93.7%) of them developed a dermatologic manifestation during the study period. Most of the patients had hematologic malignancies (n = 48, 60%). Antimetabolites were the most frequently used class of chemotherapeutic agents. Anagen effluvium was the most common dermatologic finding (61.3%, n = 49), followed by inflammatory dermatoses (51.2%, n = 41, most commonly diaper dermatitis in 33 patients), xerosis (35%, n = 28), and nail changes (20%, n = 16, most commonly nail pigmentation in seven patients). Mucositis was seen in 13 (16.2%) patients. Five patients (6.2%) had drug-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation, and five (6.2%) had toxic erythema of chemotherapy. The highest percentage of xerosis (45.4%) was detected in patients using antitumor antibiotics, whereas inflammatory dermatoses were observed more in patients using antimetabolites (48.6% of patients using antimetabolites), and pigmentation changes were more frequently detected in patients using alkylating agents.
Conclusion: Identification, diagnosis, and treatment of these reactions are important to dermatologists and oncologists so that appropriate management may be provided to pediatric oncology patients."

A suspension positioning system (SPS), based on the orthopedic suspension traction system commonly used for conservative treatment of pediatric femoral fracture and uncomplicated adult pelvic fracture, was developed to facilitate FI management in patients immobilized secondary to an acute neurological condition. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the system, a prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted between October 2009 and July 2012. Two hundred (200) elderly, bedridden, hospitalized patients with acute, nonchronic neurological impairment were randomly assigned to receive routine FI nursing care (ie, individualized dietary modification, psychological support, health education, and social support for caregivers and family members [control group]) or routine incontinence care plus the SPS (experimental group) during the day. Rates of perianal fecal contamination, skin breakdown, incontinence associated dermatitis, pressure ulcer development, and lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) were significantly lower in the SPS than in the control group (P <0.05). Length of hospitalization and costs of care were also lower in the SPS group (P <0.05). Patient quality-of-life (QoL) and FI QoL scores were similar at baseline but significantly higher (better) at the 6-month follow-up interview in the SPS than in the control group (P <0.05). In this study, the rate of FI-associated morbidities was lower and 6-month patient QoL scores were higher in the SPS than in the control group. No adverse events were observed, and all patients completed the study. Further clinical studies are needed to examine the long-term effects of SPS use among neurologically impaired FI patients."

We conducted population-based, prospective, multicenter pediatric HIV-1 surveillance in 276 children with perinatally acquired HIV-1 from 1988 to 2009. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined HIV-1 related mucocutaneous conditions among the 276 children were: category A (n = 152), B (n = 60), and C (n = 1). Nearly half of the category A and B diagnoses (43.4% [66/152] and 35.0% [21/60], respectively) occurred in the first year of life, with 59.2% (90/152) and 61.7% (37/60), respectively, occurring in the first 2 years of life. The most frequent infectious diagnosis was oropharyngeal thrush (n = 117, 42.4%); the most common inflammatory diagnosis was diaper dermatitis (n = 71, 25.7%). There was a temporal decline in the prevalence of A (pre-HAART cohort, 123; post-HAART cohort, 29; p < 0.01) and B (pre-HAART, 55; post-HAART, 5; p < 0.01) mucocutaneous diagnoses. In children with perinatal HIV-1, there was a significant decline in CDC category A and B mucocutaneous diagnoses by temporal cohort, consistent with the introduction of antiretroviral medications and HAART. Clinical category A and B mucocutaneous diagnoses were most common in the first 2 years of life, emphasizing the importance of early HIV-1 testing and HAART initiation."
595,595,Skin benefits from continuous topical administration of a zinc oxide/petrolatum formulation by a novel disposable diaper,2001,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,S Baldwin,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0926-9959.2001.00002.x,"Background: Diaper dermatitis is a common childhood affliction. Aiming to help reduce the prevalence of this problem, we have advanced in our development of a novel diaper that delivers dermatological formulations to help protect the skin from over-hydration and irritation.
Objective: To determine the clinical benefits of a novel disposable diaper designed to deliver a zinc oxide and petrolatum-based formulation continuously to the skin during use.
Methods: All studies were independent, blinded, randomized clinical trials. Study A was conducted to confirm transfer of the zinc oxide/petrolatum (ZnO/Pet) formulation from the diaper to the child's skin during use. Children wore a single diaper for 3 h or multiple diapers for 24 h. After the use period, stratum corneum samples were taken from each child and analysed for ZnO/Pet. Study B evaluated the prevention of skin irritation and barrier damage from a standard skin irritant (SLS) in an adult arm model. Study C evaluated skin erythema and diaper rash in 268 infants over a 4-week usage period. One half of the infants used the ZnO/Pet diaper, while the other half used a control diaper that was identical except for the absence of the ZnO/Pet formulation.
Results: The ointment formulation and ZnO transferred effectively from the diaper to the child's skin during product use. Transfer of ZnO increased from 4.2 microg/cm2 at 3 h to > 8 microg/cm2 at 24 h. Exposure to the formulations directly on adult skin prior to an irritant challenge was associated with up to a 3.5 reduction in skin barrier damage and skin erythema. Greatest reductions were seen for the ZnO containing formulations. Wearing of the formulation treated diaper was also associated with a significant reduction in skin erythema and diaper rash compared to the control product.
Conclusions: The results demonstrated the clinical benefits associated with continuous topical administration of a zinc oxide/petrolatum-based formulation by this novel diaper."
596,596,The Acid Mantle: A Myth or an Essential Part of Skin Health?,2018,Curr Probl Dermatol,Christian Surber,https://doi.org/10.1159/000489512,"Ninety years ago - in 1928, the term acid mantle was coined by the physicians Heinrich Schade and Alfred Marchionini in Kiel, Germany. A decade later Marchionini and several coworkers published 5 scientific communications in the Klinische Wochenschrift on ""Der SÃ¤uremantel der Haut und Bakterienabwehr"" (acid mantle and defense against bacteria). They described experimental detail, documented age- and body site as well as skin disease-dependent skin pH shifts, and discussed the significance of the pH and bacterial growth on the skin. In their fourth and fifth communication, they made the first connection between the altered quantitative and qualitative bacterial growth in pathologically modified skin and the shifted skin pH and attributed it partly to the gap in the acid mantle (pathologische LÃ¼cke des SÃ¤uremantels). They also investigated the pH of several topical dermatologic preparations and concluded that their benefit can at least partly be attributed to their acid character and recommended the systematic investigation of acid treatments in dermatology. At that time, the physiologic role of the acid skin surface was thought to be a protective mechanism against invading organisms. Hence, it seemed reasonable to allocate protection to an easy and conceivable term such as ""mantle."" Today, ""acid mantle"" as a term is still a very suitable metaphor to illustrate the protective quality of the ""acid"" in the skin and the term has become part of colloquial speech. In the meantime, our understanding of the skin pH has broadened, and we know that the acid character and its gradual change within the skin also help to orchestrate epidermal differentiation and corneocyte shedding. For many more biochemical processes within the skin, the compartmental pH is crucial, for example, in pigmentation, ion homeostasis, epidermal (stem) cell behavior, and so on. The often existing difference between the H+ concentration of extra- and intracellular as well as subcellular compartments establishes an ionic, electric, and/or osmotic driving force; hence, H+ concentration per se acts as an extra-, intra,- and subcellular signaling modality affecting and controlling many cellular functions. One may even consider pH a universal signal and effector. It is therefore also no surprise that skin pH shifts have been observed in various skin pathologies. More recently, in carefully controlled trials (acne, atopic dermatitis, incontinence-associated dermatitis, aged skin), the benefits of targeted skin acidification have become evident and the use of topical preparations with reduced pH may be recommended. The currently prevailing formulation concepts for direct acidification are based on a reduced pH of the hydrophilic product phase in combination with a buffer with a sufficiently high buffering capacity within the vehicle."
597,597,Utility of clinical parameters to identify HIV infection in infants below ten weeks of age in South Africa: a prospective cohort study,2011,BMC Pediatr,Heather B Jaspan,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-11-104,"Background: As HIV-infected infants have high mortality, the World Health Organization now recommends initiating antiretroviral therapy as early as possible in the first year of life. However, in many settings, laboratory diagnosis of HIV in infants is not readily available. We aimed to develop a clinical algorithm for HIV presumptive diagnosis in infants < 10 weeks old using screening data from the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral therapy (CHER) study in South Africa.HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected exposed infants < 10 weeks of age were identified through Vertical Transmission Prevention programs. Clinical and laboratory data were systematically recorded, groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Fisher's exact tests. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were compiled using combinations of clinical findings.
Results: 417 HIV-infected and 125 HIV-exposed, uninfected infants, median age 46 days (IQR 38-55), were included. The median CD4 percentage in HIV-infected infants was 34 (IQR 28-41)%. HIV-infected infants had lower weight-for-age, more lymphadenopathy, oral thrush, and hepatomegaly than exposed uninfected infants (Adjusted Odds Ratio 0.51, 8.8, 5.6 and 23.5 respectively; p < 0.001 for all). Sensitivity of individual signs was low (< 20%) but specificity high (98-100%). If any one of oral thrush, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, diaper dermatitis, weight < 50(th) centile are present, sensitivity for HIV infection amongst HIV-exposed infants was 86%. These algorithms performed similarly when used to predict severe immune suppression.
Conclusions: A combination of physical findings is helpful in identifying infants most likely to be HIV-infected. This may inform management algorithms and provide guidance for focused laboratory testing in some settings, and should be further validated in these settings and elsewhere."
598,598,"Symptomatic relief from at-home use of activated Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001 probiotic in infants: results from a consumer survey on the effects on diaper rash, colic symptoms, and sleep",2021,Benef Microbes,S M Dimitratos,https://doi.org/10.3920/bm2020.0229,"The gut microbiome during infancy is directly involved in the digestion of human milk, development of the immune system, and long-term health outcomes. Gut dysbiosis in early life has been linked to multiple short-term ailments, from diaper dermatitis and poor stooling habits, to poor sleep and fussiness, with mixed results in the scientific literature on the efficacy of probiotics for symptom resolution. Despite the growing interest in probiotics for consumer use, observed symptomatic relief is rarely documented. This study aims to evaluate observed symptomatic relief from at-home use of activated Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001 in infants. Consumer feedback was collected over a 2-year period via a 30-day post-purchase online survey of B. infantis EVC001 (EvivoÂ®) customers. Outcome measures included observed changes in diaper rash, symptoms of colic, and sleep behaviours in infants fed B. infantis EVC001. A total of 1,621 respondents completed the survey. Before purchasing B. infantis EVC001, the majority of respondents visited the product website, researched infant probiotics online, or consulted with their doctor or other healthcare professional. Of the participants whose infants had ever experienced diaper rash, 72% (n=448) reported improvements, and 57% of those reported complete resolution of this problem. Of those who responded to questions about gassiness/fussiness, naptime sleep, and night-time sleep behaviours, 63% (n=984), 33% (n=520), and 52% (n=806) reported resolution or improvements, respectively. Although clinical data regarding probiotic use are often inconclusive for symptom resolution, home use of B. infantis EVC001 in infants improved diaper rash, gassiness/fussiness, and sleep quality within the first week of use in a significant number of respondents who engaged in a voluntary post-purchase survey. These outcomes may be a result of the unique genetic capacity of B. infantis EVC001 to colonise the infant gut highlighting the importance of strain selection in evaluating the effects of probiotic products."
599,599,Enhancing SKIN health and safety in aged CARE (SKINCARE Trial): a study protocol for an exploratory cluster-randomized pragmatic trial,2019,Trials,Jan Kottner,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-019-3375-7,"Background: Aged long-term care receivers are affected by various adverse skin conditions like pressure ulcers, incontinence-associated dermatitis, dryness, intertrigo, and many more. Prevention of these skin problems and the provision of general hygiene and skin care activities are key areas of nursing practice. Numerous condition-specific guidelines are available and are implemented separately. On the other hand, there is huge overlap in terms of etiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of the skin conditions mentioned above. This leads to fragmented practice neglecting shared etiologies and prevention and treatment principles.
Methods: The overall aims of this trial are to test the feasibility and to estimate possible effects of the implementation of a comprehensive skin care and prevention strategy targeting main nursing-relevant skin problems at the same time. A two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial will be performed in 20 nursing homes randomly selected from the population of nursing homes of the state of Berlin, comparing skin care according to the skin care and prevention strategy with standard skin care.
Discussion: It is expected that the implementation of this evidence-based skin care and prevention strategy will reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers, incontinence dermatitis, and other skin problems frequently related to care dependency. This trial will benefit individual patients and aged nursing home residents in general given the high prevalence and incidence of the addressed skin conditions. Findings of this exploratory trial may lay the foundation for a change in the development and evaluation of clinical standards and practices in general as it moves the perspective from individual conditions to a more comprehensive view on overlapping or coexisting health problems, in this case common skin conditions, in old-age long-term care receivers.

600,600,Evaluation of Validity and Reliability of a Revised Incontinence-Associated Skin Damage Severity Instrument (IASD.D.2) by 3 Groups of Nursing Staff,2018,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Donna Z Bliss,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000466,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a revised version of the Incontinence-Associated Skin Damage Severity instrument (IASD.D.2) using 3 different groups of nursing staff. Revisions to the instrument included renumbering 1 body area where incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) occurs into 2 areas (right and left), which raised the total possible score from 52 to 56, and defining the borders of the body areas.
Design: Observational, evaluative design.
Sample and setting: Five clinical experts certified in wound, ostomy, and/or continence (WOC) nursing evaluated content validity. Evaluators were attendees at the WOC Nurses (WOCN) Society 2014 conference, hospital nurses, and nursing staff at a nursing home. Evaluators were attendees at the WOCN Society's 2014 National Conference, hospital nurses at a community hospital with Magnet designation, and nursing staff at a skilled nursing home in the Midwestern United States. The evaluator group comprised 198 conference attendees (all nurses; age 53 Â± 8.2 years, mean Â± SD), 67 hospital nurses (age 37 Â± 11 years), and 34 nursing home nursing staff (age 45 Â±13.8 years). The majority of evaluators (>75%) in each of the groups were female.
Methods: Clinical experts evaluated the content validity of the revised instrument. Evaluators scored 5 to 9 photographic cases using the revised instrument. Four of the cases were scored by all evaluators. The agreement of case scores among all evaluators was analyzed to assess interrater reliability. The scores of evaluators grouped by evaluators' self-identified skin color or nursing experience (<10 years vs â¥10 years) were also tested for differences. To provide evidence for criterion validity, the agreement of evaluators' scores with experts' scores (considered a ""gold standard"" in this study) was analyzed.
Results: The agreement of the IASD.D.2 scores among all evaluators within each group ranged from 0.74 to 0.79, suggesting good interrater reliability. The agreement of each group of evaluators with the experts for all case scores ranged from 0.82 to 0.85, suggesting good criterion validity. There was no significant difference in scores by evaluators' skin color or nursing experience.
Conclusion: The revised IASD.D.2 has good content and criterion validity and interrater reliability. The instrument has potential to standardize reporting of IAD severity in research and clinical practice and assist communication about IAD among nursing staff."

Design: Psychometric evaluation of existing instrument.
Subjects and setting: The sample comprised 440 patients managed in intensive care units of 3 hospitals across the island of Taiwan and an affiliated home care service. One hundred three nurses practicing throughout Taiwan participated in the workshops in the third phase of the experiment.
Methods: The content validity of the PAT-C was evaluated by 3 experienced nurses using the content validity index statistic. We calculated a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to determine a cut point of high-risk IAD. The curve was based on assessment of patients from receiving care from the intensive care unit and home care service of Cathay General Hospital (located in Taipei, New Paipei and Hsinchu). Nurse perceptions on the feasibility of PAT-C were assessed using an investigator-developed survey.
Results: Three experienced nurses rated the PAT-C and gave a robust overall content validity index score of 97.22%. The cut point for identifying patients at high risk for developing IAD via ROC curve analysis of 440 patients was 7.5 (sensitivity: 0.85; specificity: 0.79, area under curve: 0.82, P value < .001). One hundred three enrolled nurses attended the workshops and evaluated the feasibility using the PAT-C. Most of the participants considered the PAT-C as necessary (97.90%), 49.7% of participants suggested IAD risk assessment should be implemented by first-line (generalist) nurses, and 40% of participants recommended assessment on a daily basis.
Conclusions: Study findings indicate robust content validity, and results of the investigator survey of nurse perceptions of the PAT-C indicate the potential for its widespread use in the clinical setting. We found that a cut point score 8 or more indicates a high risk for developing IAD."

Previously available powdered products have not met the protein requirements of the preterm infant population and many neonatologists add powder protein modulars to help meet protein needs. The use of powdered products is discouraged in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) due to concern for invasive infection. The use of a commercially available acidified liquid product with higher protein content was implemented to address these two concerns. During the course of this implementation, poor growth and clinically significant acidosis of infants on Acidified Liquid HMF (ALHMF) was observed. The purpose of this study was to quantify those observations by comparing infant outcomes between groups receiving the ALHMF vs. infants receiving powdered HMF (PHMF). A retrospective chart review compared outcomes of human milk-fed premature infants<2000 g receiving the ALHMF (n=23) and the PHMF (n=46). Infant growth, enteral feeding tolerance and provision, and incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), metabolic acidosis, and diaper dermatitis were compared between the two groups. No infants were excluded from this study based on acuity. Use of ALHMF resulted in a higher incidence of metabolic acidosis (p=0.002). Growth while on HMF as measured in both g/kg/day (10.59 vs. 15.37, p<0.0001) and in g/day (23.66 vs. 31.27, p=0.0001) was slower in the ALHMF group, on increased mean cal/kg/day (128.7 vs. 117.3, p=0.13) with nearly twice as many infants on the ALHMF requiring increased fortification of enteral feedings beyond 24 cal/ounce to promote adequate growth (48% vs. 26%, p=0.10). Although we were not powered to study NEC as a primary outcome, NEC was significantly increased in the ALHMF group. (13% vs. 0%, p=0.03). Use of a LHMF in an unrestricted NICU population resulted in an increase in clinical complications within a high-acuity NICU, including metabolic acidosis and poor growth. Although further research is needed to assess outcomes among infants with a variety of clinical acuities, gestational ages, and weights to confirm these findings, based on this experience, caution is urged to avoid potential risks."
603,603,Development of a New Incontinence Containment Product and an Investigation of Its Effect on Perineal Dermatitis in Patients With Fecal Incontinence: A Pilot Study in Women,2019,Wound Manag Prev,HÃ¼lya LeblebÃ­cÃ­glu,,"Research related to the design and development of new incontinence containment products for women is scarce.
Purpose: The purpose of this 2-part study was to 1) develop a new incontinence containment product for fecal incontinence and 2) examine the effect of this new product on the occurrence of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD).
Methods: In part 1, a new incontinence containment product was designed, developed, and trialed among 10 healthy female volunteers. The product was comprised of a double layer of polypropylene nonwoven fabric and 100% cotton interlock fabric with a 3-ply 100% cotton interlock fabric added into the perianal section. Participants wore the product for 8 hours and were asked to defecate into the product and evaluate its comfort, ability to contain liquids and protect privacy, any personal allergic reaction, and air permeability. In part 2, after any product modifications, 12 bedridden women treated in the neurology unit of a hospital in western Turkey who had an indwelling urinary catheter and fecal incontinence and who did not have diabetes mellitus, a darkly pigmented area in the perianal area, pressure injury, or erythema were randomized to 2 groups (study product and control, a premium adult diaper) and monitored for 8 days for the development and severity of perineal dermatitis (scored from 0 [no erythema] to 4 [broken, abraded skin]) using a skin assessment tool. Any type of erythema was considered IAD. Skin care (cleansing with a washcloth and water) was provided daily and after each defecation to all study participants. Data were collected via paper-and-pencil completion of the perineal skin integrity assessment and patient observation forms and entered into and analyzed by a computerized statistical program. Fisher's exact test and the chi-squared test were used to analyze the difference in IAD incidence and severity between the 2 groups, and the Mann Whitney U test was used to detect differences in the number and consistency of defecations.
Results: No statistically significant differences were noted among the characteristics of the 12 participants (6 in each group) except for age; patients in the study product group were significantly older (70.66 Â± 10.36 vs 52.20 Â± 16.78 years; P <.05. Four (4) patients in the study group exhibited 13 areas of perineal dermatitis (degree 1 = 6 areas; degree 2 = 6 areas; degree 3 = 1 area; and degree 4 = 0); 1 patient in the control group had 4 areas with degree 1.
Conclusion: This prototype product is not sufficient to be used in clinical practice in patients with fecal incontinence, but further study in a larger population is warranted.."

Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) is safe and effective in reducing ammonia levels in patients with UCD above 2 months of age. This study assesses safety, ammonia control and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GPB in UCD patients below 2 months of age.
Methods: This was an open-label study in UCD patients aged 0 - 2 months, consisting of an initiation/transition period (1 - 4 days) to GPB, followed by a safety extension period (6 months to 2 years). Patients presenting with a hyperammonemic crisis (HAC) did not initiate GPB until blood ammonia levels decreased to below 100 Âµmol/L while receiving sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate and/or hemodialysis. Ammonia levels, PK analytes and safety were evaluated during transition and monthly during the safety extension for 6 months and every 3 months thereafter.
Results: All 16 patients with UCD (median age 0.48 months, range 0.1 to 2.0 months) successfully transitioned to GPB within 3 days. Average plasma ammonia level excluding HAC was 94.3 Âµmol/L at baseline and 50.4 Âµmol/L at the end of the transition period (p = 0.21). No patient had a HAC during the transition period. During the safety extension, the majority of patients had controlled ammonia levels, with mean plasma ammonia levels lower during GPB treatment than baseline. Mean glutamine levels remained within normal limits throughout the study. PK analyses indicate that UCD patients <2 months are able to hydrolyze GPB with subsequent absorption of phenylbutyric acid (PBA), metabolism to phenylacetic acid (PAA) and conjugation with glutamine. Plasma concentrations of PBA, PAA, and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) were stable during the safety extension phase and mean plasma phenylacetic acid: phenylacetylglutamine ratio remained below 2.5 suggesting no accumulation of GPB. All patients reported at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event with gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, hyperammonemia, diaper dermatitis (37.5% each), diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection and rash (31.3% each) being the most frequently reported.
Conclusions: This study supports safety and efficacy of GPB in UCD patients aged 0 -2 months who cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone. GPB undergoes intestinal hydrolysis with no accumulation in this population."

Methods: This study was a follow-up of a completed randomized control trial (RCT) of moisturizer skincare for infants aged 0-3 months. A self-reported questionnaire was mailed to the parents of children aged 1-2 years who had participated in the RCT. Data were analyzed using a Chi square test, by intention to treat analysis, and by multiple logistic regression.
Results: Of 155 infants, 22 (14.2%) and 28 (18.1%) had food allergies and AD/eczema until 2 years of age, respectively. No significant difference was seen in food allergies or AD between the group that received moisturizer skincare intervention and the control group. On the contrary, food allergies until 2 years of age were significantly associated with short-term (4-7 days) and long-term (more than 7 days) body skin problems occurring in the first 3 months of life, a family history of AD, and the time of starting complementary food. High value of face transepidermal water loss at 3 months of age was also associated with food allergies. Moreover, a short duration of severe diaper dermatitis during the first 3 months, a family history of AD, and being male were significantly associated with AD/eczema until the age of 2 years.
Conclusions: After adjusting for family history of AD, a short-term skin problem in the first 3 months of life was significantly associated with the development of food allergies or AD/eczema until the age of 2 years. Prevention or prompt treatment of skin problems in newborns is essential for preventing future allergic diseases.Trial registration This was a follow-up study conducted 2 years after the completed RCT of a moisturizer skincare intervention for early infants, which was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000013260)."
606,606,"Prevalence and Management of Urinary Incontinence in a Brazilian Hospital: A Prospective, Descriptive Study",2019,Wound Manag Prev,Eline Lima Borges,,"Although urinary incontinence (UI) in hospitalized patients is a frequent health problem, research on the subject is limited.
Purpose: A prospective, descriptive study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of UI, care implemented among hospitalized adult patients, and impact of UI on quality of life (QoL) in a large private institution in Brazil.
Methods: All patients admitted during November 2018 who were at least 18 years of age, sufficiently conscious and oriented to answer questions, able to undergo skin inspection, and had the ability to urinate (ie, did not use an indwelling bladder catheter or have a nephrostomy, cystostomy, urostomy, or vesicostomy) were eligible to participate. Data were collected through interviews, physical examinations, chart review, and completion of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICQI-SF), a self-diagnostic, 6-item survey of UI frequency, amount of leakage, and overall impact of UI; answers for items 3 (6 answer options), 4 (4 answer options), and 5 (Likert scale ranging from 0 to 10) were considered individually and summed for a total score ranging from 0 to 21. Data were collected using paper forms and then double-entered and validated in a spreadsheet for statistical analysis. Continuous variables were described as mean/median and standard deviation. Categorical variables were described in absolute numbers and percentages. Pearson's chi-squared test and Fischer's exact test were used to investigate the variable statistical differences. The level of significance was 5%, and the intervals were obtained with 95% confidence. Prevalence was defined as the percentage of people with UI over the study period in all admitted patients.
Results: Of the 858 eligible patients, 114 were incontinent (13.3%), but 61 were unable to answer the research questions, 2 used catheterization, and 9 refused to participate; therefore 42 patients (age 80 [range 77.6-82.3] years, 30 [71.4%] women) completed the study. All patients (100%) were managed using diapers. Twenty-one (21, 50%) were married, 24 (57.1%) were white, and 25 (59.5%) were retired. Sixteen (16, 38.1%) had urine loss several times a day, and 17 (40.5%) had urine loss in large amounts; 10 (23.8%) had incontinence-associated dermatitis. The ICQI-SF item regarding interference of urine loss in daily life had a reported mean of 4.1 Â± 4.0, inferring urine loss interfered with life; mean ICQI-SF score was 12.1 Â± 5.86, implying UI had a moderate impact on QoL.
Conclusion: The 13.3% prevalence of UI was similar to previous studies. The absence of a protocol for incontinence management was identified. The results suggest additional, larger sample UI prevalence studies need to be conducted."
607,607,"The effects of a multi-intervention incontinence care program on clinical, economic, and environmental outcomes",2011,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Alvisa Palese,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0b013e31820af380,"Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess the effects of a multi-intervention program consisting of use of new absorbent products, a structured skin care regimen, and nursing advice on clinical (incontinence-associated dermatitis [IAD]), economic, and environmental outcomes.
Subjects and setting: The study setting was a nursing home in northern Italy. Sixty-three patients with urinary incontinence participated, including 46 women and 17 men. Their average was 84.0 Â± 9.1 years (mean Â± SD). Thirty-five participants were entirely dependent on others for activities of daily living, such as bathing or dressing.
Design: Single-group, pre-/postintervention study.
Methods: The multi-intervention program was implemented in 3 phases: (1) initial assessment of incontinence care (phase 0, baseline measurement), (2) introduction of new absorbent products for incontinence and a structured skin care regimen (phase 1), and (3) introduction of advice provided by continence nurses (phase 2).
Results: All 63 subjects were found to have IAD at baseline.When compared to baseline measurement, the relative risk of IAD following implementation of phase 1 (new absorbent products and structured skin care regimen) was 0.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.35). Adding advice from continence nurses during this final phase (2) of the study further diminished the relative risk of IAD to 0.15 (95% CI, 0.04-0.59). In addition,the relative risk of IAD was 0.03 (95% CI 0.01-0.12) when the complete intervention (new absorbent products, structured skin care regimen, and continence nurse advice) was compared to baseline measurement. Baseline evaluation revealed that incontinent residents used an average of 5.19 absorbent products,at a mean cost of â¬ 1.79 per day. Following introduction of the multi-intervention program, the mean number of absorbent products consumed per day was 2.02 per incontinent patient, at a mean cost of â¬ 0.97 per day. In addition to these clinical and economic outcomes, implementation of the multi-intervention program reduced the daily production of waste generated by the nursing home from 33 to 11 kg/d.
Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that a multi-intervention program, including introduction of new absorbent products, a structured skin hygiene program, and advice from continence nurses, reduce the relative risk of IAD, absorbent product use, and generation of waste materials."
608,608,"Comparison of the Effectiveness of New Material Diapers versus Standard Diapers for the Prevention of Diaper Rash in Chinese Babies: A Double-Blinded, Randomized, Controlled, Cross-Over Study",2018,Biomed Res Int,Chao Yuan,https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/5874184,"Background: Diaper rash, also known as diaper dermatitis (DD), is a very common skin condition in infants, and use of disposable diapers with breathable materials is an effective approach for the management of diaper rash. In China, new material diapers and standard diapers are currently the two most commonly used disposable diapers. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of new material diapers versus standard diaper for the prevention of diaper rash in Chinese babies.
Methods: A total of 80 eligible babies admitted to Shanghai Skin Diseases Hospital during the period from June through July, 2016, were enrolled and randomized into two groups. Babies in Group A (n = 41) used the new material diapers, and babies in Group B (n = 39) used standard diapers. Two weeks after the use of the diaper, the babies used the alternate product for the next 2 weeks. Skin conditions were assessed on the front and back waist, right and left buttock, pubic region, anal region, and right and left groin using a 6-point scoring system based on four parameters in 0, 2, and 4 weeks after use of the diapers.
Results: There were changes of the mean skin assessment score in each of the six regions after the use of the diapers. There were significant differences, in the mean skin assessment score of the front waist in Group A between weeks 2 and 4 (P = 0.006) and in Group B between weeks 0 and 2 (P = 0.004), and no significant differences were detected in the mean skin assessment score of the back waist and buttock in both Group A and Group B on weeks 0, 2, and 4. A higher mean skin assessment score of the pubic region was assessed in Group A on week 4 than on week 2 (P = 0.036), with a higher score seen on week 2 than on week 0 (P = 0.048), while no significant differences were found in Group B among weeks 0, 2, or 4. There was a higher mean score of the anal region assessed in Group A on week 2 than on week 0 (P = 0.01), while a higher mean score was found in Group B on week 2 than on weeks 0 (P = 0.036) and 4 (P = 0.01). In addition, a higher mean skin assessment score of the groin was detected on week 2 than on week 0 in both Group A (P = 0.00001) and Group B (P = 0.0001).
Conclusion: The new material diaper is superior to the standard diaper for the prevention of diaper rash in Chinese babies."
609,609,Hydration vs. skin permeability to nicotinates in man,2002,Skin Res Technol,Hongbo Zhai,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0909-752x.2001.10312.x,"Background/aims: Prolonged skin occlusion increases stratum corneum water content and often increases skin permeability and irritant dermatitis. As skin wetness from wearing diapers is considered an important factor favouring the onset of diaper dermatitis, optimal diapering might decrease skin hyperhydration and dermatitis. Our aim is to define the quantitative relationship between nicotinate ester (a model penetrant) skin permeability and hydration, as measured by water evaporation rate (WER), decay curves (at individual time points) and WER-area under the curve (WER-AUC); and also to determine the level of skin hydration and skin permeability to nicotinates following a diapering simulation.
Methods/results: Nine healthy Caucasian adult women were enrolled after a prescreening procedure (time to peak redness response to nicotinate); each received three wet occlusive patches for different exposure times (10 min, 30 min, and 3h) and two wet model diapers (3 and 8 h). Prior to patching or diapering of forearms, basal values of WER, skin blood flow volume (BFV), capacitance (Cap) and redness (a*) were measured on premarked sites (a, b, c and d). Immediately, following occlusive patch or diaper removal, 20 microL of each nicotinate (methyl and hexyl nicotinate) was applied to its respective site (a or b). The WER and Cap readings were recorded at designated sites (c and d) with the following intervals after nicotinate applications: 0, 5,10,15 and 20 min. The a* and BFV measurements were made on each nicotinate challenged site (a and b) with the following intervals after nicotinate applications: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 60 min.
Results: WER-AUC and thus, skin hyperhydration, increased with occlusive patch and diaper exposure time, but there was no statistical difference between 3 and 8h diaper sites. All patched sites had significantly (P<0.05) increased hydration in comparison to control sites (undiapered or unpatched skin). Cap increased with occlusion time with patches, but not with diapers. The degree and time-course of redness from nicotinates did not vary with extent of skin hydration, but was significantly increased compared to non-hydrated skin. BFV-AUC did not show a significant increase between diapers at 3 and 8h sites; the BFV-AUC values varied on the patched sites, but some were significantly (P<0.05) higher than control site.
Conclusion: Wet patches and diapers increased skin hyperhydration proportional to exposure time. Permeation of nicotinates was increased for hydrated skin vs. control, even after only 10 min of patch exposure. For these model permeants, we found no evidence of increased permeation rates with increased hyperhydration, once a relatively low threshold of hyperhydration was achieved (e.g. that reached after a 10 min wet patch). The data showed no meaningful differences in permeation following either diapering simulation and also suggested that the WER-AUC method was superior to capacitance for measuring the absolute extent of hyperhydration. We believe this is a suitable model for evaluating the quality of diaper product performance, as well as in pharmacologic assays of occlusive therapy."

This statistic rises to 30% in late pregnancy and in immunosuppressed patients. The most often occurring species is Candida albicans. Host factors, especially local defense deficiencies, gene polymorphisms, allergic factors, serum glucose levels, antibiotics, psychosocial stress and estrogens influence the risk for a Candida vulvovaginitis. In less than 10% of all cases, non-albicans species, especially C. glabrata, but in rare cases also Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cause a vulvovaginitis, often with fewer clinical signs and symptoms. Typical symptoms include premenstrual itching, burning, redness and non-odorous discharge. Although pruritus and inflammation of the vaginal introitus are typical symptoms, only less than 50% of women with genital pruritus suffer from a Candida vulvovaginitis. Diagnostic tools are anamnesis, evaluation of clinical signs, the microscopic investigation of the vaginal fluid by phase contrast (400 x), vaginal pH-value and, in clinically and microscopically uncertain or in recurrent cases, yeast culture with species determination. The success rate for treatment of acute vaginal candidosis is approximately 80%. Vaginal preparations containing polyenes, imidazoles and ciclopiroxolamine or oral triazoles, which are not allowed during pregnancy, are all equally effective. C. glabrata is resistant to the usual dosages of all local antimycotics. Therefore, vaginal boric acid suppositories or vaginal flucytosine are recommended, but not allowed or available in all countries. Therefore, high doses of 800 mg fluconazole/day for 2-3 weeks are recommended in Germany. Due to increasing resistence, oral posaconazole 2 Ã 400 mg/day plus local ciclopiroxolamine or nystatin for 15 days was discussed. C. krusei is resistant to triazoles. Side effects, toxicity, embryotoxicity and allergy are not clinically important. A vaginal clotrimazole treatment in the first trimester of pregnancy has shown to reduce the rate of preterm births in two studies. Resistance of C. albicans does not play a clinically important role in vulvovaginal candidosis. Although it is not necessary to treat vaginal candida colonization in healthy women, it is recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy in Germany, because the rate of oral thrush and diaper dermatitis in mature healthy newborns, induced by the colonization during vaginal delivery, is significantly reduced through prophylaxis. Chronic recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis requires a ""chronic recurrent"" suppression therapy, until immunological treatment becomes available. Weekly to monthly oral fluconazole regimes suppress relapses well, but cessation of therapy after 6 or 12 months leads to relapses in 50% of cases. Decreasing-dose maintenance regime of 200 mg fluconazole from an initial 3 times a week to once monthly (Donders 2008) leads to more acceptable results. Future studies should include candida autovaccination, antibodies against candida virulence factors and other immunological trials. Probiotics should also be considered in further studies. Over the counter (OTC) treatment must be reduced."
611,611,"A starch, glycyrretinic, zinc oxide and bisabolol based cream in the treatment of chronic mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in children: a three-center, assessor blinded trial",2017,Minerva Pediatr,Amelia Licari,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4946.17.05015-0,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very common chronic inflammatory and eczematous skin condition characterized by flares and remissions. Skin barrier alteration or dysfunction is the most relevant patogenetic factor. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment of AD, especially during flare periods. The daily use of emollients and moisturizers is also considered a relevant adjunctive strategy to improve skin barrier function and skin appearance in AD patients. Long-term use of topical corticosteroids is associated with important drawbacks and side effects. A corticosteroid-free cream containing starch, glycyrretinic acid, zinc oxide and bisabolol (Dermamidâ¢; Difa Cooper, Caronno Pertusella, Varese, Italy) has been designed for the treatment of acute eczematous conditions like diaper dermatitis. However, this formulation could be particularly suitable also for AD. We evaluated in a three-center, assessor-blinded prospective 6-week treatment trial the efficacy and tolerability of this cream in children with chronic mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis.
Methods: A total of 30 children (mean age 5 years, 18 males and 12 females) with chronic mild to moderate AD, affecting face, lower and upper limbs or trunk, were enrolled after parents' written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were a condition of immunosuppression, acute flares or a positive history of allergy to one of the components of the cream. The primary outcome was the evolution total eczema severity score (TESS) calculated as the sum of the single eczema severity score for each body area involved. Single area Eczema Severity Score (ESS) was calculated assessing eczema, infiltration, lichenification and scraching lesions using a 4-point scale grade (with 0=no sign, and 4=severe sign). A secondary endpoint was the percentage of subjects reaching at least 50% of TESS reduction at week 6 in comparison with baseline. The TESS was evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment (twice daily application) in an assessor-blind fashion.
Results: At baseline the mean (SD) TESS was 11.6 (4.7). TESS was reduced significantly (P=0.0001) to 5.7 (3) after 3 weeks (-51%), and to 3.0 (2.3) at week 6 (-74%). Similar reductions were observed for single area ESS values. The percentage of subjects with at least a >50% reduction of TESS value at the end of the study was 87%. The product was very well tolerated. Only for one patient a mild burning sensation at the application site was reported. All the subjects concluded the trial.
Conclusions: This trial supports the efficacy and the tolerability of a corticosteroid-free cream containing starch, glycyrretinic acid and bisabolol in the treatment of chronic mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children."
612,612,"A Prospective, Multicenter Study to Compare a Disposable, High-fluid Capacity Underpad to Nonpermeable, Disposable, Reusable Containment Products on Incontinence-associated Dermatitis Rates Among Skilled Nursing Facility Residents",2017,Ostomy Wound Manage,Glenda Motta,,"Due to the high prevalence of incontinence among skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents, incontinence-associated derma- titis (IAD) is a common occurrence. In addition, facility staff may mistakenly identify IAD as a pressure injury. A prospective, descriptive, multicenter study was conducted in 3 Connecticut facilities to evaluate the effect of substituting a disposable, high- uid capacity underpad for nonpermeable disposable and reusable containment products on the rate of IADs. Residents with and without IAD but with high IAD risk scores who were bed- or chairbound or ambulatory and used disposable nonpermeable briefs and underpads or reusable, laundered containment products when in bed longer than 2 hours were randomly enrolled and observed for a 4-week period. Facility staff were trained on the importance of differentiating between IAD and pressure injury; they substituted the study product (a disposable, high- uid capacity underpad) for all previously used containment products. Patient risk for IAD and skin condition were assessed using the Perineal Assessment Tool (PAT) and the Skin Condition Assessment Tool (SAT), respectively, at 5 time points: baseline, week 1, week 2, week 3, and week 4. The PAT is a 4-item instrument based conceptually on the 4 determinants in perineal skin breakdown; subscales are rated from 1 (least risk) to 3 (most risk), with a total score range of 4 to 12. The SAT is used to evaluate IAD speci cally, generating a cumulative severity score ranging from 0 to 3 on area of skin affected, degree of redness, and depth of ero- sion. Final data analysis was conducted on 40 residents: 25 had IAD present at enrollment and 15 were deemed high risk for developing IAD. Mean SAT scores in the 25 participants with IAD decreased with signi cance at week 1 (P = .0016), week 2 (P = .0023), week 3 (P = .0005), and week 4 (P <.0001). Baseline IAD severity scores averaged 3.3 Â± 1.7. Overall IAD average severity scores in this group decreased from baseline mean of 3.3 Â± 1.7 to 0.7 Â± 1.4 at week 4 (P <.001). The 15 participants with intact, nondamaged skin at enrollment did not develop IAD from baseline to week 4, and PAT score risk levels decreased from high (7 or greater) to low (6 or less) as a result of a speci c reduction in the duration of irritant exposure category for 11 (73%) of this group of participants by week 4. PAT risk level scores for both IAD and non-IAD participants at baseline averaged 8.1 Â± 1.4; after 4 weeks, they averaged 7.0 Â± 1.5). Although change was not significant, results suggest the use of a disposable, high- uid capacity underpad improved SAT scores over time. IAD rates increased in each facility, but pressure injury incidence rates decreased for the study duration. Replacing a nonpermeable, reusable containment product with a disposable, high- uid capacity underpad when SNF residents are in bed longer than 2 hours may impact the severity of IAD and reduce its incidence. The inverse impact reported on IAD and pressure injury incidence rates 1 month after training suggest study educational efforts had a short-lasting effect. Future research is indicated to determine the most effective method to improve nurses' ability to identify and distinguish IAD from pressure injury in the SNF setting."
