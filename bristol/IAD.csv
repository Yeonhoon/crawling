For the therapy nurses and parents have the choice between numerous barrier creams based on zinc oxide, Dexpanthenol or Vaseline in various combinations of active agents and with additional ingredients. Research question: Which combination of active ingredients in local barrier creams reduce pain, severity of or duration of healing in IAD in neonates, infants and young children? Method: MEDLINE and CINAHL was systematically search for randomized controlled trials on the effect of barrier creams in pediatric patients with IAD. These were evaluated on validity and applicability. Results: 15 RCTs were found, of which six were included in the systematic review. The methodological quality of these trials ranges from good to poor, partially high bias risk were recognizable. Barrier creams containing the active ingredients zinc oxide / lanolin, zinc oxide / cod liver oil, zinc oxide / Dexpanthenol, paraffin / beeswax / Dexpanthenol show effects. They reduce the IAD-associated symptoms. Conclusions: The investigated barrier creams can be used in the pediatric nursing for the treatment of IAD. Because of limitations it cannot be ruled out that further studies will change the results."
1,Prevention and Management of Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis in the Pediatric Population: An Integrative Review,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Yvonne Siew Ling Lim,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000490,"An integrative review was conducted to synthesize evidence on prevention and management of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) in the pediatric population. A 5-step integrative process was used to guide the review. Articles published from January 2000 to April 6, 2017, were identified and retrieved from CINAHL, PubMed, ProQuest (MEDLINE), and Scopus; key terms were associated with IAD, pediatric, prevention, and management. Supplemental and manual searches were carried out to identify other relevant studies. The studies' findings were extracted and summarized in a table of evidence, with their quality evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Checklist. Sixteen articles were included in the review. Articles explored prevention and management strategies including skin cleansing technique, diaper selection, and the application of topical skin care products. Inconsistent and limited evidence was found regarding the benefits of using disposable wipes in preference to water-moistened washcloths in the cleansing process and on the use of superabsorbent polymer diapers with breathable outer lining in IAD prevention. Findings were inconclusive with regard to the best topical skin care product for IAD care. However, the application of skin protectants was encouraged by the authors, as well as promoted in various clinical guidelines. The development of a structured skin care regimen supplemented by a comprehensive patient education program was advised to enhance the prevention and management of IAD."
2,Improving diaper design to address incontinence associated dermatitis,BMC Geriatr,Anne-Marie Beguin,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2318-10-86,"Background: Incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD) is an inflammatory skin disease mainly triggered by prolonged skin contact with urine, feces but also liberal detergent use when cleansing the skin. To minimize the epidermal barrier challenge we optimized the design of adult incontinence briefs. In the fluid absorption area we interposed a special type of acidic, curled-type of cellulose between the top sheet in contact with the skin and the absorption core beneath containing the polyacrylate superabsorber. The intention was to minimize disturbance of the already weak acid mantle of aged skin. We also employed air-permeable side panels to minimize skin occlusion and swelling of the stratum corneum.
Methods: The surface pH of diapers was measured after repeated wetting with a urine substitute fluid at the level of the top sheet. Occlusive effects and hydration of the stratum corneum were measured after a 4 hour application of different side panel materials by corneometry on human volunteers. Finally, we evaluated skin symptoms in 12 patients with preexisting IAD for 21 days following the institutional switch to the optimized diaper design. Local skin care protocols remained in place unchanged.
Results: The improved design created a surface pH of 4.6 which was stable even after repeated wetting throughout a 5 hour period. The ""standard design"" briefs had values of 7.1, which is alkaline compared to the acidic surface of normal skin. Side panels made from non-woven material with an air-permeability of more than 1200 l/m2/s avoided excessive hydration of the stratum corneum when compared to the commonly employed air-impermeable plastic films. Resolution of pre-existing IAD skin lesions was noted in 8 out of 12 patients after the switch to the optimized brief design.
Conclusions: An improved design of adult-type briefs can create an acidic pH on the surface and breathable side panels avoid over-hydration of the stratum corneum and occlusion. This may support the epidermal barrier function and may help to reduce the occurrence of IAD."

Consistent preventive skin care or treatment may reduce the incidence of IAD. The authors propose using an IAD classification and intervention tool (IADIT) to make detecting and treating IAD easier and more consistent.
4,"Assessing absorbent products' effectiveness for the prevention and management of incontinence-associated dermatitis caused by urinary, faecal or double adult incontinence: A systematic review",J Tissue Viability,Yuko Mugita,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtv.2021.07.002,"Objective: Adults who suffer from incontinence are at substantial risk of developing incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). In healthcare settings, several interventions have been implemented to prevent or manage IAD, and several absorbent products have been developed for incontinent patients; however, there is no systematic review that has reported on which absorbent products are effective for the prevention or management of incontinence-associated dermatitis. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of absorbent products in the prevention and management of IAD.
Methods: MEDLINE (1946-August 31, 2020), CINAHL (1982-August 31, 2020), and Cochrane Library (August 31, 2020) were searched for relevant articles.
Results: Eight studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review, including two randomized controlled trials that were designed to evaluate the efficacy of absorbent products on the prevention or management of incontinence-associated dermatitis. Quality of evidence was assessed as low or very low. The findings revealed that some outcomes related to IAD prevention or improvement of IAD can be positively affected by the introduction of a new absorbent product or a difference in the frequency of pad changing, which can control the overhydration of the skin.
Conclusions: The studies included in this review indicated that the problem of control of overhydration of the skin associated with urine and/or faeces can be controlled by absorbent products and these products may be effective for the prevention or management of incontinence-associated dermatitis. Future research with high-quality studies is required."
5,Skin Health Connected to the Use of Absorbent Hygiene Products: A Review,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),Johanna Karlsson Bender,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13555-017-0189-y,"Over the past 50 years, absorbent hygiene products such as baby diapers and incontinence products have become essential features of modern day life. Through innovation and enhanced technology, their design, composition and performance have been dramatically upgraded from their early forms, and they have transformed the lives of millions of people, improving their quality of life. Skin health related to the use of absorbent hygiene products has accordingly also greatly improved. Still, the wearing of absorbent hygiene products will affect the skin, and for some users the changes in microclimate, mechanical interactions and the exposure to urine and faeces may result in irritant contact dermatitis, i.e. diaper dermatitis (DD) or incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). Babies with developing skin and the elderly with deteriorating skin functions who are the most frequent users of absorbent hygiene products are more vulnerable to the causal factors. Although irritant reactions are the most common, allergic contact dermatitis should be considered if a DD/IAD fails to improve by recommended actions. There is also a connection between IAD and pressure ulcer development of which it is important to be aware. A holistic approach of using high-quality absorbent hygiene products in combination with appropriate skin care will help maintaining good skin health."
6,Development of a New Incontinence Containment Product and an Investigation of Its Effect on Perineal Dermatitis in Patients With Fecal Incontinence: A Pilot Study in Women,Wound Manag Prev,Hülya Leblebícíglu,,"Research related to the design and development of new incontinence containment products for women is scarce.
Purpose: The purpose of this 2-part study was to 1) develop a new incontinence containment product for fecal incontinence and 2) examine the effect of this new product on the occurrence of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD).
Methods: In part 1, a new incontinence containment product was designed, developed, and trialed among 10 healthy female volunteers. The product was comprised of a double layer of polypropylene nonwoven fabric and 100% cotton interlock fabric with a 3-ply 100% cotton interlock fabric added into the perianal section. Participants wore the product for 8 hours and were asked to defecate into the product and evaluate its comfort, ability to contain liquids and protect privacy, any personal allergic reaction, and air permeability. In part 2, after any product modifications, 12 bedridden women treated in the neurology unit of a hospital in western Turkey who had an indwelling urinary catheter and fecal incontinence and who did not have diabetes mellitus, a darkly pigmented area in the perianal area, pressure injury, or erythema were randomized to 2 groups (study product and control, a premium adult diaper) and monitored for 8 days for the development and severity of perineal dermatitis (scored from 0 [no erythema] to 4 [broken, abraded skin]) using a skin assessment tool. Any type of erythema was considered IAD. Skin care (cleansing with a washcloth and water) was provided daily and after each defecation to all study participants. Data were collected via paper-and-pencil completion of the perineal skin integrity assessment and patient observation forms and entered into and analyzed by a computerized statistical program. Fisher's exact test and the chi-squared test were used to analyze the difference in IAD incidence and severity between the 2 groups, and the Mann Whitney U test was used to detect differences in the number and consistency of defecations.
Results: No statistically significant differences were noted among the characteristics of the 12 participants (6 in each group) except for age; patients in the study product group were significantly older (70.66 ± 10.36 vs 52.20 ± 16.78 years; P <.05. Four (4) patients in the study group exhibited 13 areas of perineal dermatitis (degree 1 = 6 areas; degree 2 = 6 areas; degree 3 = 1 area; and degree 4 = 0); 1 patient in the control group had 4 areas with degree 1.
Conclusion: This prototype product is not sufficient to be used in clinical practice in patients with fecal incontinence, but further study in a larger population is warranted.."

9,A Smart Diaper System Using Bluetooth and Smartphones to Automatically Detect Urination and Volume of Voiding: Prospective Observational Pilot Study in an Acute Care Hospital,J Med Internet Res,Jae Ho Cho,https://doi.org/10.2196/29979,"Background: Caregivers of patients who wear conventional diapers are required to check for voiding every hour because prolonged wearing of wet diapers causes health problems including diaper dermatitis and urinary tract infections. However, frequent checking is labor intensive and disturbs patients' and caregivers' sleep. Furthermore, assessing patients' urine output with diapers in an acute care setting is difficult. Recently, a smart diaper system with wetness detection technology was developed to solve these issues.
Objective: We aimed to evaluate the applicability of the smart diaper system for urinary detection, its accuracy in measuring voiding volume, and its effect on incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) occurrence in an acute care hospital.
Methods: This prospective, observational, single-arm pilot study was conducted at a single tertiary hospital. We recruited 35 participants aged ≥50 years who were wearing diapers due to incontinence between August and November 2020. When the smart diaper becomes wet, the smart diaper system notifies the caregiver to change the diaper and measures voiding volume automatically. Caregivers were instructed to record the weight of wet diapers on frequency volume charts (FVCs). We determined the voiding detection rate of the smart diaper system and compared the urine volume as automatically calculated by the smart diaper system with the volume recorded on FVCs. Agreement between the two measurements was estimated using a Bland-Altman plot. We also checked for the occurrence or aggravation of IAD and bed sores.
Results: A total of 30 participants completed the protocol and 390 episodes of urination were recorded. There were 108 records (27.7%) on both the FVCs and the smart diaper system, 258 (66.2%) on the FVCs alone, 18 (4.6%) on the smart diaper system alone, and 6 (1.5%) on the FVCs with sensing device lost. The detection rate of the smart diaper system was 32.8% (126/384). When analyzing records concurrently listed in both the FVCs and the smart diaper system, linear regression showed a strong correlation between the two measurements (R2=0.88, P<.001). The Bland-Altman assessment showed good agreement between the two measurements, with a mean difference of -4.2 mL and 95% limits of agreement of -96.7 mL and 88.3 mL. New occurrence and aggravation of IAD and bed sores were not observed. Bed sores improved in one participant.
Conclusions: The smart diaper system showed acceptable accuracy for measuring urine volume and it could replace conventional FVCs in acute setting hospitals. Furthermore, the smart diaper system has the potential advantage of preventing IAD development and bed sore worsening. However, the detection rate of the smart diaper system was lower than expected. Detection rate polarization among participants was observed, and improvements in the user interface and convenience are needed for older individuals who are unfamiliar with the smart diaper system."
10,Efficacy of an improved absorbent pad on incontinence-associated dermatitis in older women: cluster randomized controlled trial,BMC Geriatr,Junko Sugama,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2318-12-22,"Background: Most older adults with urinary incontinence use absorbent pads. Because of exposure to moisture and chemical irritating substances in urine, the perineal skin region is always at risk for development of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of an improved absorbent pad against IAD.
Methods: A cluster randomized controlled design was used to compare the efficacy of two absorbent pads. Female inpatients aged ≥65 years who had IAD and used an absorbent pad or diaper all day were enrolled. Healing rate of IAD and variables of skin barrier function such as skin pH and skin moisture were compared between the usual absorbent pad group (n = 30) and the test absorbent pad group (n = 30).
Results: Thirteen patients (43.3%) from the test absorbent pad group and 4 patients (13.3%) from the usual absorbent pad group recovered completely from IAD. Moreover, the test absorbent pad group healed significantly faster than the usual absorbent pad group (p = 0.009). On the other hand, there were no significant differences between the two groups in skin barrier function.
Conclusion: The test absorbent pad for older adults with urinary incontinence might be more efficacious against IAD than usual absorbent pad.

11,Prospective trial for the clinical efficacy of anogenital skin care with miconazole nitrate-containing soap for diaper candidiasis,J Dermatol,Hidenori Takahashi,https://doi.org/10.1111/1346-8138.15257,"Anogenital skin care for the elderly remains an umbrella term concerning protective and non-interventional regimens, particularly for ordinary diaper users. Our recent investigation has demonstrated the preventive effect of daily anogenital washing with miconazole nitrate-containing soap to the development of diaper candidiasis. We extended this work to cover our hypothesis as to whether the miconazole soap has a therapeutic benefit in genital candidiasis. The study outline includes: (i) the enrollment of 21 bedridden inpatients (84 ± 9 years; eight men and 13 women) who were diagnosed clinically and mycologically with genital candidiasis, and who had never received topical and/or systemic antifungal agents; (ii) administration of anogenital washing with 0.75% miconazole-containing soap once daily for 4 weeks; and (iii) assessment of clinical symptoms and detection of Candida materials by culture and microscopic examination. As assessed by clinical symptom scoring for incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), the ratio of patients with severe to moderate symptoms dramatically decreased by 2 weeks and 10 of 21 patients became symptom-free at 4 weeks. The IAD clinical severity score was significantly decreased at 4 weeks. Compared with the baseline positivity, both microscopic and cultured Candida-positive rates were significantly decreased at 4 weeks after washing. All culture-detected fungi were Candida albicans. Severe adverse events did not occur in all participants. Individual medical and risk factors had no significant correlation with clinical severity and duration of candidiasis on variance analysis. In conclusion, topical washing with miconazole soap is a safe and reliable non-medical approach for soothing diaper-associated genital candidiasis in bedridden inpatients in whom it is difficult to perform prompt medical examination."
12,Development of a pressure ulcer trigger tool for the neonatal population,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Bette Schumacher,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0b013e31826a4d99,"A large Midwest level IIIb neonatal intensive care unit located in a 500-bed teaching hospital implemented quarterly skin prevalence surveys to monitor prevalence of altered skin integrity including pressure ulcers, diaper dermatitis (incontinence-associated dermatitis), and skin damage as a result of intravenous therapy, adhesive, or medical devices. Pressure ulcer prevalence varied from 0% to 1% per quarter, and no pressure ulcer risk assessment tool was regularly implemented. Therefore, a working group was formed to identify a risk assessment. The Iowa Model for Evidence-Based Practice was used to guide the project. A literature review was completed to identify validated instruments, but available tools were judged lengthy for routine clinical use. Therefore, we developed a short trigger tool comprising 3 questions to identify infants at risk for pressure ulcer development."
13,An Exploratory Study of Skin Problems Experienced by UK Nursing Home Residents Using Different Pad Designs,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Sinead Clarke-OʼNeill,https://doi.org/10.1097/won.0000000000000177,"Purpose: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) among nursing home-based incontinence pad users varies between pad designs. A second aim was to examine the utility of a simple method for reporting skin health problems in which healthcare assistants were asked to record basic observational data at each pad change.
Study design: Randomized, multiple crossover, observational, exploratory.
Subjects and setting: Twenty-one men and 57 women using absorbent continence products to contain urinary and/or fecal incontinence were recruited from 10 nursing homes in London and the south of England.
Methods: A day-time variant and a night-time variant of each of the 4 main disposable pad designs on the market for moderate/heavy incontinence were tested: (1) insert pads with stretch pants; (2) 1-piece all-in-one diapers; (3) pull-up pants; and (4) belted/T-shape diapers. All pad variants for day-time use had an absorption capacity of 1900 mL ± 20% (measured using ISO 11948-1 International Standards Organization) while the capacity of night-time variants was 2400 mL ± 20%. Each resident used each of the 4 pad designs (day-time and night-time variants) for 2 weeks and the order of testing was randomized by nursing home. Skin health data were collected using 2 methods in parallel. Method 1 comprised visual observation by researchers (1 observation per pad design; 4 observations in total over 8 weeks). In method 2, healthcare assistants logged observational data on skin health at every pad change for the 8 weeks. The primary outcome variable was severity of the most severe skin problem noted by the researcher for each resident, and for each pad design (method 1). Descriptive data on skin care methods used in the nursing homes were also collected using short questionnaires and researcher observation.
Results: No significant differences in the severity or incidence of skin problems were found between observations using the 4 pad designs. However, a wide range of skin conditions was recorded that made classification difficult; the skin was often marked with creases from absorbent products, temporary marks, and pink/purple discoloration. We observed few cases of the severe erythema, rashes, and vesicles that are commonly used descriptors in previous skin tools. Nevertheless, the collected data reflect an abundance of skin problems that were difficult to categorize neatly. Researcher observations (method 1) showed that nearly all the residents (96%) had at least 1 IAD skin problem recorded over the 8-week period and 64% of residents had at least 1 problem that was rated as maximum severity. Healthcare assistants logged skin problems on 6.1% of pad changes. The discrepancy between researcher and healthcare assistant data appears to be largely due to healthcare assistants sometimes discounting low-grade IAD as normal for that population.
Conclusion: Incontinence-associated dermatitis is common among nursing home residents who use incontinence pads, and it is often severe. No evidence was found that any design of pad was more likely than any others to be associated with skin problems. The method devised to enable healthcare assistants to record basic observational data on skin health in the diaper area at each pad change (Method 2) proved simple to use but still resulted in substantial underreporting of IAD, suggesting that further work is needed to develop a tool that more successfully encourages them to log and treat IAD problems."
